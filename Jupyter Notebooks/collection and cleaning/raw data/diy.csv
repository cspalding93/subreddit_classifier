"Badly damaged exterior wall studs, is this out of the purview of a relatively green DIYer?",2,0,"[Pictures.](https://imgur.com/a/uafBlta) This is just one of the four  studs that need to be replaced or repaired in our shed, one of them is worse than this one but I can't access it at the moment. All of them have the same damage from, I presume, termites, but there are no termites anymore. 

From what I've read, sistering it would be ideal, putting new studs on both sides and tying them together through the old stud. In that case, should I just leave the old stud there? There are also the crossboards that are all in pretty good shape. Should I remove them before sistering the stud? Is there any danger in that? I realize the stud itself pretty much can't be load bearing anymore, but better safe than sorry.

Thanks!"

Need ideas for converting rain gutter into planter box,2,2,"For reference, [photos can be found here](https://imgur.com/a/dmoz40C)

My wife and I are planning on listing out townhouse very soon. We recently had to demolish a previously built addition in the back because of hurricane water damage (Side note, we essentially brought the space back to it's initial state). We've been wanting to improve this back patio area for curb appeal but kept the existing rain gutter (Image 1) in case we wanted to re-use it. It seems though that the roof overshoots where the gutter would go by a little bit (Image 2), so using it as a gutter would be a little pointless. Plus we don't want to put in too much more money into improvements to add a new gutter that would drain further out into the shared green space. 

I've read about converting old gutters into planter boxes. Because it's such a large piece and already spans the existing length of the back area, and also because I do not have a reciprocating saw, I'd rather keep the gutter intact. I've seen gutter brackets at HD (Image 3) and a case study of gutter/planters installed on fences (Image 4). Has anyone had experience dong something similar? If I get enough brackets, would it be strong enough to support the weight of the gutter plus some top soil and plants? Should I stick to air plants instead? Thanks in advance."

questions about building a deck,1,5,"I recently built a **free standing** deck for a friend. We decided to build it without getting a permit first, only because of the time frame that we were in and not because of trying to cut any corners. We live in upstate NY, and the town that this is in didn't have any specifications to building a deck, just to follow standard code.

&#x200B;

Monday: dug 9 holes to code and poured our 6"" cement base

Tuesday: placed our 9 6x6 and re-supported until dry 

Wednesday: placed our 3 double beams and built all the joists, started to place the deck boards, only got about 10 done out of 50ish

Friday: Deck boards, and placed 4x4 post for railings (with carriage bolts)

Saturday: finished railing and all touch ups

&#x200B;

Beginning of the next week he got a letter in the mail from the town code enforcer stating that they noticed ""a structure that looks to be a deck"" on the back of the house. etc etc etc, now they wanted him to go through the permit process.

All is well, we send everything in, and he gets a reply letter. It states 3 problems, well sorta problems.....

&#x200B;

1. ""please provide a letter showing what the measurements for the post holes depth and what was in place on the bottom of the posts"" it goes on to show different examples of how it can be done.

okay, shame on me for not putting it on the blueprints, so this is an easy fix/explanation.

2. ""the middle center post of the deck needs to provide a bracket to support the post to the beam"" it goes on to say u can either place the double beam on top of the post and use a bracket or to notch out the 6x6 and place them on top and attach using bolts. Here's the kicker, it explains it a little further and says ""deck beams shall be attached to deck posts in accordance w figure ( which is the notched way or the bracket on top of post) or by equivalent means capable to resist lateral displacement. **All bolts shall have washers under the head and nut. Carriage bolts are not permitted.""** 

The actual problem doesn't list the problem being the bolts, only to verify how the center post is attached to the beam. I have never heard that carriage bolts can't be used , and is this something that might need to be changed?

3. ""All joist hangers are missing nails""

WHAT?!?!?!? I know for a fact, a so certain fact that I would put my paycheck on it that EVERY hole in all the joist hangers are full except the angled holes. I have never heard of the angled holes needing a nail. Is this something new?

&#x200B;

Thanks for your time and help with anything that you have knowledge for ( and please save yourself the time with the ""check your local codes etc etc "" because I know the code, I build my deck with the same methods about 1.5-2 years prior to this, and not 1 single problem, only difference being the size and the township)"

Freezing washer drain pipe,1,9,"Background: My sister-in-law called me a couple weeks ago and told me that every winter her washer drain pipe freezes, making her unable to do laundry. She asked for my help and I thought I'd just put some heat tape around it and problem solved.

So I went over to her house and she showed me the pipe in question. It runs out of a broken piece of the foundation and is totally exposed to outside weather. My heat tape idea was immediately out for a few reasons, most notably lack of an outlet and the location of the pipe, complete with being half buried in the ground. I tried searching for different solutions but could not find anything suitable or even a similar situation. She said she asked a plumber who was out recently and he said he didn't really have any ideas outside of packing straw on top of it. That didn't seem like a very good solution to me, but using my own knowledge and research has led me nowhere. Any other ideas on how to deal with this or is the straw the best solution here?

[Pic](http://imgur.com/a/iu3RCVB)

Edit with more info: After getting some responses here, I called my sister-in-law and dug for a little more info. She doesn't know anything about plumbing, but connecting the dots, it seems this is the main drain for the whole house. The reason she noticed it most with the washer is the washer is the final connection before the line leaves the house. She told me that when is gets really cold, none of the sinks or bathtub will drain. With that said, rerouting the pipe likely isn't an option. The house was built in the 1890s and plumbing was (very poorly) shoehorned into this house. She said that when she had plumbing work done a few years ago, they had to rip out the floor in one of her rooms to get to the pipes, but the floor was fixed afterward - so even seeing the indoor plumbing at this point is unlikely. This likely leaves my options at doing what is possible to the visible portion of the pipe in the picture."

Building a Planter Box on My Balcony Rail,0,3,"Hi there -- A few days ago my neighbor cut down a great old tree in between our yards. I was kind of bummed out at first, but today I was sitting on my porch and stunned at how much light it was getting. With the extra light, it now seems like a great place to grow a few herbs.

Here's [the spot](https://imgur.com/a/rcsvFoK).

I've watched a few planter how-to videos and read a couple tutorials, but I have two questions that I haven't seen answered:

1. How should I fix the planter to the rail? I can't build it on top, and as you can see from the photos (particularly photo two) the top of the rail isn't flat, which means I can't use a piece of metal or something like that. 
2. I don't have table saw, which almost every tutorial takes for granted. I can borrow other tools from friends but I don't really have access to the table saw. 

If anyone has answers, or suggestions, or links to resources that might help me make this thing, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading."

I need to make this roller and place it in between the rear wheels (length between the wheels is 12 7/8 inch) The material can be plastic pipe, metal or wood. The roller diameter should be 7 3/8 inch (as that is the diameter of the wheels that it comes with).

I couldn't find any reasonably priced plastic or metal options. I am planning to buy 2x10 8ft and make 8 count of 7 3/8 inch wheels and stick them together between the wheels. I can't find a 7 3/8 inch hole-saw, so I need to cut them out using a jigsaw, which is going to be both time-consuming and mostly nonuniform wheels.

Any ideas on making the roller would really be helpfull. Unfortunately, I only have basic power tools (drills, circular saw, jig saw and miter-saw).

Mounting Expensive Skyline Mirror To Wall,2,2,"I want to hang up this mirror on the wall next to my apartment's front door, but I want to make sure it's extra secure so that it doesn't fall and break. It's an older mirror and some of the wood panels on the back for mounting it onto the wall are loose. Also, the wall that I will be hanging it on shakes a decent amount when either the front door slams or our neighbors slam their front door.

Any tips for hanging this up securely and/or fixing the wood panels on the back of the mirror? I am considering asking someone on TaskRabbit who has experience mounting artwork to make sure it's done nicely.

Btw, the mirror is 4 pieces. Not sure if that matters.

Mystery junction box,1,2,
what do you do when the electrical work is difficult to access? cannot get to junction box,3,12,"Wanted to install a Panasonic whisper bathroom vent fan in my master bath last weekend - seemed like an easy enough weekend project that might take an hour or two after watching some videos and doing some reading. Our house is mostly one story, we have one tiny room upstairs, but the rest is just attic - which normally makes things easier in so far as accessing electrical is concerned. However, we ran into a serious road block - it appears our HVAC system is on top of the junction box for the electrical work in our bathroom. Ugh. I'm going to keep digging around the insulation that was blown on top of our ceiling but judging by where it SHOULD be (from measuring stuff) it appears it's underneath the HVAC, which is sitting on top of floor boards.

What now? Do I need to install a new circuit just to make this work? But even then, I'm having trouble imagining how I can install a switch (our original plan was to wire the fan up with the shower light, so that it would turn on when you turn on the shower light), because the bathroom current switches are directly under the HVAC as well.  I think creating a new circuit might be beyond our DIY skills but I'm not sure, it also seems like overkill. Secondly - IIRC from doing some stuff in our guest bath (which is immediately adjacent to the master) shares a circuit with the master. I don't know if that might mean there is somewhere else that we can access electrical in the attic or not. As I said I will keep digging around in the insulation hoping to find something but so far I""m not having luck. HELP! Our tiny bathroom desperately needs a ventilation fan system, it's too hot (and humid) where we live to open the window most of the year, and I'm constantly battling mold trying to grow in the shower and on the window (yuck).

Forgive me if I'm not using proper terminology (correct me if that's the case) - my husband is the one who mostly does the electrical stuff, I'm usually just helping by holding something in place or whatever. My DIY skills aren't really the electrical kind.

&#x200B;

I imagine this is a more common problem for people living in two story homes when you need to access the electrical for light fixtures on the first floor - so I'm hoping there will be enough people here that can guide me."

Unsure how to remove window,0,1,"I've got these windows around my front door.  They appear to be fixed double pane, and the rubber gasket between the panes is bucking up and it's unsightly.  

I want to pull the panes off to fix the gasket buckling, but the wooden stops around the inside of the sash are weird.  I'm not sure how to proceed.

It appears to just be a wooden rectangular frame, and each side of the stop appears to have one or two holes in or near the middle of the side, in which someone's tapped a tiny finishing nail (in the direction of the sash, not the glass), in such a way that I can't just pull it out.  

But it really looks like if I can just get those nails removed, I should just be able to loosen and then pull off the stop, and then remove the glass pane.

Replacing gas fireplace with electric,0,4,"Hello all, any insight would be appreciated. 

We have an older, 20+ year, gas fireplace that came with the house we bought three years ago. We are tired of the dated insert and cant stand the smell when it is on. We are looking at replacing it and wanted input on a few things. 

First, let me just say I am the least handy man I know...

Second, how difficult would it be to remove all pieces of the hearth? There's a marble front and siding as well as a Millwood? Mantle. 

Third, how difficult to remove old gas insert and seal/cap gas line?

Fourth, how difficult to frame out from there to put in a mountable electric fireplace flush with new framed wall area?

Ideally wed build the frame to the ceiling (8feet) and place a stone veneer around it complete with a floating mantle. 

Im not sure Im using the right terminology or if Im being clear in what Im looking to do but am asking for any helpful insight. 

Is any of this doable by myself? Approximate costs for hiring someone to do it?

Again, thank you for your time."

Add wood to steel garage door?,2,10,"I have a pretty old, maybe 70's era white steel garage door. It's fairly thick steel, not like the new, cheap garage doors sold at big box stores today.  It has quite a bit of corrugation to the panels that runs parallel to the ground, making it even stronger. 

Rather than get rid of the very strong, but ugly white, plain, garage door, I've considered adding strips of Ipe wood to it running parallel to the ground. 

Has anyone ever seen this done? Will my 1/2 HP garage door opener be able to lift it if I have the spring adjusted for the additional weight?

I'm thinking something like this:

[help] Picnic table staining problem...,1,2,"[Picnic table pics](https://imgur.com/a/0mt4lDn)

Thanks in advance for any help from the DIY community!!  (obligatory long time lurker, first time poster...)

Earlier this summer, I purchased a build it yourself picnic table kit from Lowes, for putting on our deck.  If youve ever shopped at Lowes, you always see them sitting outside of the store.  I had been thinking about getting one for the family, so I finally bought one when they were on sale in July.  (If climate and context matter as we get into this question, Im in the US Southeast.)  

I brought it home, put the raw lumber together with the included hardware relatively easily, and let it sit on our deck for about a week.  It seems important to note that the four leg pieces are pressure treated lumber, but the rest of it is not.  I purchased a gallon of Valspar one-coat exterior stain and sealer, the semi-transparent variety that promises 6 years of protection from weather.  (I bought the cedar color, which is fine, but it looks kind of orangeish in the photos I took.)  I sanded the wood and then applied the stain in a single coat, after the table had been assembled and sitting outside for maybe 9 or 10 days total.   Very little rain during this time period, I would add.

The problem:  after just a few weeks, the table started to look blackened.  If you take a look at the photos, youll see what Im talking about, with the weird bubbly black and gray shapes in the close-up, and the black streaking in some other areas of the wood.  (The really light colored marks and spots are just sidewalk chalk from my three-year-old from yesterday.)

Can anyone tell me whats going on here?  And what I did wrong and/or what I need to do to fix this?  Is it mold?  The wood reacting badly to the stain?  Im perplexed at what is causing this, and after a couple months, it only keeps getting worse.  

Thanks!!"

Electrical: a few outlets in a circuit are out,1,18,"I was out of town and my wife plugged something in. She heard a pop (doesn't remember where it came from) and the outlet was dead. A nearby outlet was also dead. Other outlets on the same circuit are fine. I came home last night and:

* Put a multimeter on the hot and negative (and hot and ground) in the outlets, got nothing. Pulled the outlets out of the box, probed the wires attached to the outlet, nothing.
* Opened the breaker completely, then closed it again. Nothing.

I live in a rural area so the concept of ""just call an electrician"" isn't quite so easy. I'm happy to do it, but if there's some additional trouble shooting that doesn't involve me ripping the drywall off I'd love to do it. Even if I put a call into an electrician I'll probably be sitting here for a week or two with half my living room not powered up. Tool wise I have:

* Digital multimeter. 
* Non contact voltage meter.
* Wire nuts, spare romex, etc.

Moved to a new 4th floor apartment with dangerous windows and need advice,0,17,"As the title suggests, I need advice on improving the safety of the windows in my new apartment. It is on the forth floor and the windows in the living room open out fully. It's a really nice feature but unfortunately the sills are only about 3.5 feet above the floor and honestly it's quite scary standing beside them when they're open. It wouldn't be outrageous to suggest you could trip and fall out the window. The windows open inwards so i reckoned it would be possible to put bars or wires across the opening to stop anyone from falling out. I tried googling a few things but couldn't find any good examples of the best way to deal with this? I feel like wires attached to hooks that are screwed into the window reveals could work well and also wouldn't obstruct the view much.

Is that drywall behind my shower tile?!,1,12,"So my daughter thought the shower soap holder was a foot rest used when shaving her legs. Surprisingly, it didnt hold up and came unglued. She also has used the shower several times since then and the backer got wet.

I removed the old adhesive and Im letting it dry out. Im not a experienced handyman, but I know a backer should be used behind the tile. This stuff has the consistency of wet drywall. I know anything is possible. The house was built in 2006 and this bathroom has not been remodeled. So I assume a legit builder wouldnt use drywall. Is there a backer that could have the same issues?

Either way, I need to replace the soap holder. I have the adhesive and know how to do that part. My question is, what should I do about the wet backer board I assume let it dry out and seal it somehow? It doesnt seem like the soap holder adhesive would stick to it even if it was dry.

And then simply either making a countertop out of 3/4"" plywood and edging it with oak strips or at least for speed and cost just buying a countertop from Ikea and putting it on top.

The Ikea solution would be about the same price as doing it myself and would be lighter leaving more weight for the monitors, PC, etc to be mounted to the desk. But the only problem that I see is that many of the lighter counters are using compressed unbleached paper for structural integrity. And I have seen some people have problems with the desk breaking when they attach a monitor stand to the countertop. Which I think I could stop with 12"" diamond plate under the counter.

So I'm thinking a combination of some cleaning chemicals with elbow grease and fine grit sanding.

  


Also any suggestions of paint brand? I'm UK based.

  


Any advice?

  


Thanks"

I figured out what was wrong with my noise fridge and used a piece of cardboard to stop the noise. Is there something less flammable that I should use instead?,4,16,"https://i.imgur.com/EFwaASH.jpg 

Apparently the common problem with this fridge is that the black bit (compressor) rattles against the metal bit behind it. I jammed some 4x thick cardboard behind it and the noises stopped INSTANTLY. What a relief! LG wanted $375 to replace the thing that probably wouldn't fix it.

Anyway, cardboard is flammable and compressors get hot. So I'm a little worried about fire. On the one hand, the rubber on the compressor that's been there all along temped at 140 degrees Fahrenheit and the cardboard has lots of airflow and it's around 90f. Cardboard doesn't spontaneously ignite until 421f.

A: do I leave the cardboard in there? It probably won't ever ignite, right?

B: if not A, what should I replace it with? I'm willing to spend some money on something as long as it makes sense!"

I don't think just leaving it is the right action to take. Is there something, like plumbers putty or a wrap, that I can put around this to contain any leaks if they develop? Or is cutting it and putting in a straight joint the way to go? Or maybe something else?

Advice on Cleaning & Sealing Brick Basement,7,4,"  

[https://imgur.com/a/xKBJAJi](https://imgur.com/a/xKBJAJi)

Help! I need your advice on how to improve the brick foundation of my house. Pictured is the interior.

**First off, whats going on?** 

During rainstorms, water seeps through the brick itself. Water also leaks through that 100 year old casement window. I have a floor drain so I dont have real flooding issues but I see all this scaling and want to fix it. Visually there is no missing mortar, and when I inspect with my hands there isnt any loose mortar or bricks.

**My current plan to fix**

I want to clean the brick and seal it with Drylock. I dont have the money for new windows right now, so I am planning to cover the window with a sheet of Lexan and just seal it up with Flexseal or some other adhesive, to keep out the elements.

**My specific questions**

\- How can I clean the brick? I thought of taping up some painting tarp plastic on my joists and HVAC equipment and using a pressure washer, honestly. Or I could scrub with a brush and a bleach solution. Or should I use just water? Some other kind of soap?

\- Do I need my brick re-pointed? Per my point above, visually it looks fine and just touching it with my hands there isnt loose mortar or bricks.

\- Is Drylock the right solution here? When it rains, you can see the droplets of water form on the inside of the wall; I dont have the money for digging drains and trenches and whatnot, can I just paint it with the Drylock to keep my basement drier during a storm? I dont intend to finish the basement at this point, I just want it to be drier down there.

**Other info:** 1929 construction, wood frame on brick foundation with two steel I-beams, half the footprint is a true basement and half is just foundation, located in Richmond VA.

**TLDR:** Whats the right way to clean this brick in my basement, and then how do I keep water out?"

Air Compressor issues...,1,16,"Hey everyone.

I have a 60 gal air compressor.

I just recently replaced the pump as it was not working anymore. I am running into a problem where the motor slowly quits as the pressure in the tank approaches 15 PSI.

Just took the motor in for a service and it passed with flying colors.

When the tank valve is open, the motor runs the pump just fine and can pump air for 30+ minutes. The moment the valve is closed, the motor starts to labor and slowly quits.

I have ruled out the motor as an issue, the electrical is not an issue as it has been running fine for years before this.

Any thoughts?! It's too expensive to have a tech come out as they charge per hour to even drive here so I'm looking at $250.- just to have them take a look. Thanks"

do I need an additional 4 Amp fuse for the fan, or is the 4 Amp fuse already in the fan sufficient?

Table or handheld wetsaw? Tile cut advice,1,4,"Hi all

We are doing full interior renovation, am up to the last job. Need to do about 100m2 worth of floor tiling and a splashback. Just after some advice

Have done smaller ceramic tile jobs when i was younger using manual tile cutters and a grinder, however we are using porcelain ( 600x600 ) and really want the best results to match the time and effort we have already put in the house. 

I was thinking of using a handheld tile wetsaw for the whole job on a work bench with the rail guide. I would like to know if this is a bad idea. The reason is i feel as though I find some use for the tool again in the future.

The other option is the table wetsaw which is a bit more expensive and i probably won't use it for a while.

I dont want to hire because the job will take me a while being a amateur and we are living in the house so things have to be shuffled around.

[2GIG](https://i.redd.it/1tsscw05q4r31.jpg)

I moved in a house recently. The house already has a 2GIG device, with an existing alarm code set up by the previous owner, which I don't know what it is. I don't know how to set up my onw alarm code either. The goal is to use this device to self monitor for home security. For DIY guru here, how to DIY remove the existing alarm code and then set up my own alarm code for 2GIG system, if that is possible to DIY?

I also called a local dealer A. Dealer A quoted me a very high price to set up the device (service fee), such that I can self monitor. Then I called dealer B, who quoted a very low fee to set up the device, but required me to sign a three year contract with a monthly fee with them. I called dealer C, who quoted a reasonable fee to set up the device, but asked me to pay them monthly without a contract, which means after one month I can terminate with them any time. Both Dealer B and C told me that 2GIG device can't be used for self monitor, and a homeowner has to pay a dealer to monitor their home.

So now I am confused and seek help here: Can 2GIG device be used for self monitoring? If it can be used for self monitoring, can I set up myself, to remove the existing alarm code set up by the previous owner, and then set up my own alarm code? Thank you very much."

"Found mold in my attic, sprayed with Concrobium. Doesn't seem to be working. What am I doing wrong?",2,13,"A few weeks ago I ventured into my attic to clean out the dryer vent. I found, much to my surprise that all of my vents (2x bathroom + 1x dryer) had come undone from the roof ports and were venting warm moist air into my attic. 

I went up this weekend to clear out any moldy insulation which was minimal and to spray Concrobium on all of the visible mold. This was the general recommendation I saw on reddit for mold remediation. 

The mold is mostly localized to the underside of the plywood roof and some of the beams. It's the worst near the peak of the roof and around any of the roof vents. I would say I have about 500sq ft of mold. It ranges in concentration from little spots to large black dense concentrations.

So I sprayed the shit out of it where it looked the worst and lightly sprayed anywhere that was just starting with mold. 

I went up about 20 hours later. The bottle said it should kill it in 2 hours, but to wait 24 to paint over it. Nothing had really changed. There were some spots that I had really sprayed the hell out of that looked much better and some spots that I had also sprayed the hell out of that looked the same.

Did I do something wrong, maybe I needed to just soak the entire attic? Do I need to get up there and scrub away the mold? Has it just stained my plywood forever?"
Need an Intermediate base 3-way lightbulb for my favourite lamp. Seemingly does not exist? :-(,2,11,"My mom gave me a lamp that her mom bought for her 10 or 15 years ago. It's a Laura Ashley 3 stage lamp and I love it.

Well recently the original bulb went, and we discovered  (after sticking many regular bulbs in) that we'd need a 3-way bulb. Firstly, these don't seem to exist here in Ireland or Europe anymore. They exist in America, but they all seem to have medium bases? I can't find any with an intermediate base.

How can there be literally no bulb for this lamp in the entire world? It's really bumming me out."

Sealing wood interior siding to reduce splinters?,2,6,"My wife and I bought our house in April.  We have a (now) 10 month old who walks along the sides of the room holding onto the wall.  

So, there's 2 interior walls with wood siding similar to the attached picture. The wood isn't sealed and has small splinters coming off it and I had to spend some time last night pulling said splinters out of her hand which I would love to avoid in the future.  

Aside from sanding all the wood smooth, is there any kind of sealer I could apply that would help? 

This project is now #1 on my honey-do list.

Painting over distemper ceiling. Any advice?,1,5,"We live in the UK in a house built in the late 1950s. Our lounge ceiling has swirly artex on it, but we've been told the ceiling has originally been coated with distemper (which is cheap chalk powder mixed with glue, they used it to cheaply, quickly decorate house interiors after WWII). We found out we had distemper after trying to paint over the ceiling when we moved in... the paint just fell down, leaving us with patches and flaking bits all over our ceiling. Nothing sticks to it. 

My father-in-law things if we mix an oil-based paint (like a gloss) with thinner, then it'll soak into the pores of the distemper and will stick to the ceiling and cover up all the flakes and peeling bits. He says its try that, or pay to get the whole ceiling boarded over. 

Has anyone tried the oil-based paint solution for distemper? Will it work?"

Cracking grout.,3,15,"Hi everyone. A few years ago we purchased a house from some self-taught flippers. They made some poor decisions and shortcuts, most of which we've been able to correct. The issue that endures to this day is the cracking grout between the tiles in the kitchen.   
The issue is that the house is raised wood frame construction, it was built in the 1940's, and the floor is not perfectly level. They put down tile that was 24x24 in the kitchen without leveling things out, is my guess. It creaks and pops in some areas. I know that the ultimate solution is likely to remove the tiles and replace them with smaller ones. However, I'm looking for suggestions on ways to bring longevity to the existing floor while we save up to replace it.   


What we've done so far:   
\- purchased ""fix-a-floor"" and stabilized most hollow-sounding spots on the floor. This has actually worked far better than I thought it would, and I highly recommend the product! 

\- Scraped out old cracked grout.

\- Used pre-mixed color-matched grout to fill in all gaps and holes.

  
I'm wondering if there is a product that would mimic grout, but is flexible? I'm worried that the tiles themselves will start cracking if the floor is too rigid. If the grout was flexible and allowed them a little bit of give, I'm thinking it could help extend the floors life for now."

The weird thing is that when the sand dried, it was still just sand. Like no bonding or curing whatsoever. So I took more sand and refilled some spots where it washed out, and watered again. Same results. Ive watered it four or five times now, but the sand will not do anything other than just... dry? Has anyone here worked with this stuff before? Is there something that Im missing, or some trick to it? Thanks in advance for any help!"

Drilling through plasterboard/drywall into brick above fireplace to mount television,7,14,"Hi all. Sorry if the title is a bit scrambled, but it seems the best way to word it.

Basically I have a brick fireplace in my living room, and the television currently sits on the mantle. I want to mount the television to the wall.

Currently, the wall is drywall (I think, but it could be plasterboard) and behind it is brick. There are studs in the wall but they are very far apart, too far apart for the mount to fit correctly, so my options are to leave it standing on the mantle, or mount it into the brick.

My issue is, I've never done that before and don't want to mess up my walls more than I have to.

DIY | How to Install the Incra TS-LS Positioner on the Ridgid R4512 Table Saw,3,2," 

https://i.redd.it/cldbebug3zq31.jpg

Hey Guys! I just recently installed an Incra LS Positioner on my Ridgid R4512 Table Saw and I want to share the installation process with you. Inca was having a sale and I jumped at the chance. This table saw fence is incredible! By far the most accurate and versatile fence I have ever seen. So let dive into the installation process.

***\*Please use this post as just a guide. Refer to the instruction manual for full details.***

One of the downfalls from ordering this fence from Incra is the shipping lead times which can be up to 9 WEEKS! I talk to one of the Incra reps and he said with the tariffs and high demand of the fence, the production lead times were stretched to the max. I guess that is a good problem to have. So, when you order, be patient. It's worth the wait. The shipment includes 2 boxes (at least mine did). One box for the rails and the other box contains the fence parts and hardware. Be warned, the boxes are quite heavy with the stacked aluminum inside. The instruction manual was one of the most well-written manuals I have ever seen. Each bag of screws and hardware where labeled and included in the steps in the manual. So you can easily reference the corresponding part numbers.

1. Removing the old fence from the R4512 is super easy. This fence is absolute garbage and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemies. Remove all the bolts from the spacer rail, the rail bolts under the front of the table, at the back of the table, and the bolts holding the extension wings. (the bain of my existence) Good riddance!

&#x200B;

[Remove the rails and extension wings](https://i.redd.it/gltq4b6j3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

2. This would be a good time to give the table saw a good cleaning. Use an air compressor or a can of air dust to blow off any sawdust. Wipe down the sides and table with some WD40. Also, this would be a good time to remove any rust from the top and recoat it with some GlideCoat

3.  Take the rail mounts and attach them to the pre-existing bolt holes. You only need to use 2 mounts per side. Each mount attaches to the 2 end bolt holes of the cast iron top. The middle mount is not needed on the R4512. Only use the 3 mounts if your saw cast iron top is wider. (Grizzly, PowerMatic, Sawstop saws, ETC are usually wider) Space the mounts a 1/4"" from the top. Once there are spaced properly. Tighten the bolts so it doesn't shift when installing the rails.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/k31bvv5r3zq31.jpg

Pro Tip: There is absolutely no need to drill and tap any new holes in the cast iron top as others have suggested. Incra provides several different size bolts. The only real issue I had was the back rail mounts. But it wasn't really an issue when I figured out to just use the bolts that attached the old back rail. It worked beautifully.

4. Attach the t-nuts to the front and back mounting brackets. Then slide the rails into place. Space the rail dead center of the table. We will adjust this later.

[Attach the t-nuts that accepts the rails](https://i.redd.it/gjjup4xs3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

5. Tighten the t-nut bolts to secure the rail into place. Loosen the bolts on the mounting brackets. Use the positioner arm mounting brackets and clamp them to the bottom of the rails. Move the rail assembly up or down until the backside of the brackets are flush with the top of the cast iron top. This is going to ensure the rails are at the proper height. Then tighten the bolts to secure the rail mounting brackets.

[Clamp the Mounts to the bottom rail and flush the top](https://i.redd.it/bseg5zcx3zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

6. Now it's time to assembly the positioner arm. Assemble the stop knobs and insert them into the right side of the rails. There are 4 stop knobs. 2 on the front and 2 on the back.

[Stop knob assembly](https://i.redd.it/qr8puqp14zq31.jpg)

7. Attach the glide pad to the bottom of the positioner bracket. Install the screw and nuts to each bracket then slide it into play on the positioner cross member. Leave the screws loose as we will need to adjust its position in a later step.

[Remove the philm and attached the glide pads](https://i.redd.it/sste4ix34zq31.jpg)

8. Flip the cross member over and install the Positioner into place. You will need to space the positioner 11"" from the edge. I used a large square and a ruler to get the exact spacing. Tighten the outside screws to lock it down

[Slide the positioner into place on the cross member and use a ruler\\square to position it](https://i.redd.it/zg12som54zq31.jpg)

9. Remove one of the brackets and slide it on top of the stop knob. Mount the cross member and positioner on to the rails. Then slide the opposite bracket and cross member on the backstop knobs. Then slide the cross member into the front mounting bracket.

[Attach the cross member into the bracket mounts](https://i.redd.it/5lwbenh74zq31.jpg)

10. Slide the cross member back so that it's spaced 37 1/4"" away from the blade. I used the miter slot and measured 32"" because I know my miter slot is 5 1/4"" away from the blade. This makes it easier to use a tape measure. Once the spacing is correct. Tighten the screws on the mounting brackets to lock it into place.

[Position the cross member 37 1\/4\\"" from the blade](https://i.redd.it/hf1whs794zq31.jpg)

11. Attach the front mounting bracket to the positioner arm. Then slide the arm into the positioner. Note: there is a small lip on the side of the arm that slides into the receive lip on the positioner. Once you have those lips engaged the arm slides freely. This can be a bit tricky.

[Installed fence mounting bracket](https://i.redd.it/3k3hpujd4zq31.jpg)

[Slide the arm into place](https://i.redd.it/uwhkzhff4zq31.jpg)

12. Slide the fence into the mounting brack of the arm. Leave the screws loose so we can calibrate it in a later step.

[Slide the fence into place using the bottom t-track](https://i.redd.it/0byh6rth4zq31.jpg)

&#x200B;

13. Install the Fence hold down brackets into the front and back of the fence.

[Install the front and back hold down brackets. This prevents the fence from lifting up during cutting operations. Don't tighten any bolts](https://i.redd.it/iptk1lkl4zq31.jpg)

14. Time to make the new extension wings (My favorite part). I made the wings out of phenolic laminated plywood so they will not have any seasonal movement. You can use whatever you would like. Melamine or MDF would be a good choice as well. Each wing is supported by a pair of cleats. Rip 2 cleats for each size and then cut them to width according to your spacings. The spacings are going to be different according to the size of the Positioner you purchased. Drill holes into each cleat according to the provided instructions in the Incra manual. Attach the clients using washer, bolt, and nut to the rails. Make sure the head of the bolts you use is large enough to fit into the t-track on the rail. Measure the width and length of the openings and rip the plywood accordingly. Place the plywood on top of the cleats and fastening into place with l-brackets to the cleats on the underside.

&#x200B;

15. Final Calibration.

* Place a piece of 3/4"" plywood scrap into the miter slot and butt the fence up next to it. Adjust the arm and position so that it's square. Tighten down the screws on the positioner to lock it into place.
* place popsicle sticks (2 stacked on top of each other) under the fence. Space each pair equally down the length of the fence.
* with the fence mounting bracket screws loose, raise the arm until it's parallel to the rails. Tighten the bolts on the mounting bracket. Test to see if the arm slides easily. If it does not slide easily, it's not parallel to the rails. Keep adjusting the height until it slides easily. This is a crucial step in the process or the fence will not work properly.
* Slide the fence to 1/32"" away from the blade. Set the fence into micro-adjustment mode by raising the red lever on the positioner to the middle position. Rotate the red dial away from you until the fence kisses the blade. Lock the fence into place
* Detach the magnetic ruler and slide it down the arm until the zero marking is lined up with the line indicator in the positioner window. Hold down one end of the ruler and attach the rest of the ruler into place. Make a couple of test cuts and adjust accordingly.

Removal of Diverter Valve Help,1,3,"Hello Fellow Plumbers,

First off, I appreciate any advice here. I am removing an old shower dial and its diverter valve in order to install a shower panel with flexible inlet hoses. I might get lucky with the work, as the shower panel hose fits the male hot and cold water inlet perfectly. My question is mostly on the removal of the old diverter valve in a safe manner, meaning I don't want my bathroom to look like a pool afterwards.

1. Is it sufficient to just turn off the valve on the hot and cold water inlet as pictured, or do I need to shut off the entire water supply to the house to work on the removal?
2. From the close up pic, to my surprise, the diverter valve appears to be screwed into the cold and hot water pipes, as opposed to being soldered in. Do I simply just unscrew the diverter valve? And are there risks for pipe breakage? I'm a little worried about the old pipes and joints. The top outlet for the shower appears to be soldered in though.
3. There is a piece of wood in the background that's right behind the diverter valve. Assuming I need to turn the diverter valve for removal, can I just cut the wood off without risking structural damage? I think it's just support for the outlet valve at the top? What's the best tool - angular saw?

Hope you guys enjoy my collage of photos. Thanks all!

Simple open joint cladding ideas,0,0,"Hi all - I've built a small lean-to style shed next to my house. The framing is 16"" OC, about 6.5 ft in the front and 7ft in the back (only 27"" depth due to space limitation).  
The back wall (towards house) is already sided with LP SmartSide Panels but I'm thinking of being more creative on the other three sides - hence the question on open joint/gap siding. I think it would be cool to have a modern geometrical look next to my traditional looking lap siding. 

The main downsides are that some of the purpose-built wrap products - whether 3D grooves for drainage or to be used with furring strips - are insanely expensive and would be wasteful for such a small project. The reason I don't like furring strips is that it seems like the gap would be excessive (at least 1/2"" behind the siding) and I have to worry about wasps/hornets in my area.  

So my idea is to sheathe the entire structure with OSB and use 30# felt to cover it generously, perhaps double layers. But rather than putting furring strips, I was thinking about attaching each siding panel with a washer or spacer (like 1/8"") behind it and a nice looking SS steel fastener through the siding, washer, felt, and into the OSB (maybe the stud?). 

It's a small shed. I plan to use LP SmartSide Smooth (12"" wide) planks that are cut to right size (so 27"" by 12"" on side walls, longer on the front wall). I'm thinking maybe 1/4"" gap between, not sure what would look right until I see it. 

Two questions:  

1) How long do you think tar paper lasts in the gaps? Only one side gets sun. I'll definitely have two layers in each gap.  

2) Would the washers provide enough of a gap?  

Hoping someone who has done open joint siding before can chime in. Thank you."

Hanging a painting on drywall with concrete behind?,49,29,"Hi everyone,

I was recently given a large piece of art that would look great on the bedroom wall. The issue is that the wall is drywall (roughly 5/8"") with concrete directly behind. Since I'm in a condo, I spoke with building management and can't screw directly into the concrete, so tapcons are out.

The picture is roughly 55"" x 79"", and weighs close to 25lbs. It has an aluminum frame built for [security bracket hangers](https://imgur.com/a/6jBDl7S) (at least I think that's what they're called). If you have any ideas to mount it, it would be really appreciated!"
Is there such a thing as a self-leveling swivel caster? My office chair's casters are not vertical and creak obnoxiously when I move perpendicular to the slant.,0,1,"[Here's a pic of a similar model.](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/813eB62rHfL._AC_SL1500_.jpg) Mine is discontinued, but this has the same problem: height adjustment does not account for the caster angle, and after fitting it to my height the casters ended up 5-10 from vertical.

Over time the swivel peg^(?) wore down its housing, aggravating the slant and skewing the forks until the wheels started squeaking against them.

I could u-bolt the front legs of this thing onto two pieces of hardwood and use screw-on casters to solve the problem - the back legs would rest on the wood and glide with adjustments. It would be easier to drill new, vertical holes next to the old, worn ones and bolt on a swivel caster, but I wouldn't be able to adjust the height without running into the same problem, **unless** there exists a swivel caster that self-levels up to 15 of skew.

*side-node: the ""housing"" for the swivel casters is the plastic cap that goes into the tube legs. This cap spins freely, so the only thing holding the caster's angle is a hole in the thin metal tube...*"
Lead Painted Bathroom Ceiling Removal advice requested,2,13,"Hey all,

We live in a 1901 house. We have one daughter and more planned. We had a blood test done with an elevated lead level. Long story short or bathroom ceiling has lead paint and it is chipping/peeling. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom.

The bathroom is pretty small 10'x6' nearly rectangular. I'm almost sure the ceiling is plaster and lathe.

Here is my dilemma, I want to fix the ceiling and add a exhaust fan. I know there are several precautions that need to be taken (hepa vac, plastic off the room and HVAC, etc) but what would you do with the ceiling itself? Cut out the whole thing and re sheetrock? Scape the paint and repaint? Scrape and encapsulate?

Any advice is welcomed."

Stuck on how to install a replacement window in this opening.,5,2," I've been slowly working the way through house replacing windows. Most of them are traditional wooden windows with a sash cord, and so are pretty straightforward to drop in vinyl replacement windows.

However, the last few have been replaced once before using an older system and I am not sure what to do. Pictures of the system here: [https://imgur.com/a/W4dSv96](https://imgur.com/a/W4dSv96)

From what have found out Googling, this is some kind of older-style replacement window. The channels that the windows are running in are aluminum. I would assume that I can just tear the metal bits out. However, since the replacement windows rest against the outer stop and the stop would be gone...not sure what to do. And I can't find any non-destructive way to get it out, so once I tear it apart, I'm committed.

I thought maybe the best approach would be to tear the whole thing out and use a new-construction window -- it's on the first floor and I have good external access to the window -- but I'd really rather not remove the outside trim and possibly siding if I don't have to.

Thanks!"

Storage shelf stability,131,19,"I'm making a standing storage shelf unit. There are 4 frame pieces that hold each shelf at each level.

I don't have any studs to attach it to. Is there a way I can make it more stable without attaching it to the house?

I was thinking about connecting the top corner of the frame on one end to the bottom corner of the frame on the other end, using a long piece of wood along the back. Maybe it would be enough to do that between just one frame and the next frame, to avoid using a ten foot piece.

Edit: thanks all. I added a single plywood panel, about 14 inches tall, between the two middle frames on the back and the stability was hugely improved."

An old school desk is new again!!,2,0,"A friend of mine had an old school desk she picked up at a flea market.  It was a cool design from the mid-20th century with an amazing oak top.  Unfortunately, the desk has been the victim of multiple artistic rehabilitations, improper repairs, and eventually left in the weather for an extended period of time.

Even though the desk was complete, it was really bad condition.  The project started with a complete disassembly. I then moved to stripping off all of the paint, first with a chemical striper, then wire brushing, and ultimately sanding everything smooth.  All the metal work was repaired, then primed and painted with Rustoleum primer and spray paint.   The woodwork was repaired, sanded using a variety of methods from 80 to 220 grits and then finished with Verathane Summer Oak and seven coats of a water-based poly gloss clear coat sanded in between at 220 and polished and buffed.  Finally, the desk and chair were reassembled and delivered back to its owners. I could not have been happier with the result, that brought this piece of Americana back to it original luster and appearance.

Converting stove/range from 4- to 3-prong,1,11,"Hey DIY,

My partner and I recently bought our first house. It was built in the 80s.

We have a gas range, but unfortunately there is no gas line to the kitchen. Currently we are on a tight budget and so we decided to purchase a used electric range for cheap in the meantime.

We brought the range home but noticed that we have a 3-prong outlet while the range has a 4-prong cable.

I decided to try replacing the cable but I noticed that there was absolutely no ground connection. After doing some light research and looking at the owners manual for the range, I've determined that the ground strap that was originally going from the neutral terminal to the body of the appliance was removed forcefully.

I brainstormed with my dad and we had the idea of cutting the end off of the ground wire and using that in place of the ground strap.

Best way to clean the rust and repaint my evaporative (swamp) cooler? Is it even worth it?,1,8,"My swamp cooler is over 10 years old (came with the house I bought 10 years ago, so I'm not sure how old it is) and the pan, as well as the side panels, are getting pretty rusty and the paint is starting to peel. It's going to take a lot of work to remove the old paint, sand to bare metal, prime, and repaint. A new swamp cooler costs around $2500 to install where I live. Whereas new parts and materials to ""update"" (replace all the guts but the main motor and clean up the outside) the one I have now would be around $500 because they're not really that complicated.   


My worry is that I will spend all of this time getting it cleaned up and redone only to have the same rust come through in a year or two. I'm also curious if I *need* to get all the way down to bare metal as I described or if there as an easier/better way to do this project.

Diy toddler climbing wall - pick apart my design please!,1,2,"Howdy all, 
  Looking to build a ~10' outdoor wall mounted, adjustable incline climbing wall for my 3 year old. A link to my first draft is below. Basically, attach 4 2x4s vertically to the outside wall. Build the climbing wall separately with 1x4 planks secured to 2x4 sub structures which use the wall mounted 2x4s as a track. Secure the wall at the top using 2 metal rods that insert from the middle (outer walls make it difficult to insert from the sides). I want something adjustable and something that easily tucks fairly flat against the wall. 

  Issues I see:
1) The wall is going to be heavy, and I want to make sure that it's securely attached to the outside wall (stucco with 1/2"" plywood underneath). 

2) Relocating it up and down is not something we'll be doing every day, more like every month. 

  Please feel free to critique, and if I move forward I'll be sure post the whole thing start to finish!

Shower Base and Drain Help,2,6,"Full disclosure here, I am a moderately ambitious DIYer, but I feel very much out of my league on this project! So, any help or guidance you can give me would be appreciated.

I'm working on replacing the floor tile on my 1960's shower that sits above my garage in our split level house. My goal was not only to replace the tile itself because it was very old and pretty nasty, but to examine the shower base beneath which I knew was compromised, because it had started slowly dripping into my garage below. I've pulled up the tile and it was very obvious where water was getting through (to the right of the drain in image #1 below) because the material in this area was soft and somewhat muddy / sandy whereas everywhere else it was firm and hard. In the pictures below I have dug out that area to get to the subfloor beneath (which is not very rotted, but definitely damp).

I was also able to determine (I'm pretty sure) how water was getting into my garage below. If you look at the third picture below, you can see my finger pointing to a gap around this flange or whatever on the drain pipe. I think this area was saturated with water, and that was the release point for any excess water that came through. This is consistent with what we were seeing below with water dripping down this pipe on the outside of it. You can see a little bit of daylight in picture #4, and this is where my finger is in picture #3 where I've dug out all the way to this part of the drain.

Here are some [images](https://imgur.com/a/qXoK5bU) to show what I'm talking about.

So, this leads me to a few questions:

1. How was water getting through in the first place? My guess is that it was slowly seeping through my tiles in this section of the shower. We had very small tiles, which means a ton of grout lines. It makes sense to me that, over time, those seals in between tiles were not keeping water out, and water was slowly getting below below, and here we are. The water saturated that section, and then the water found a release under that part of the drain shown in the pictures. Agree, or think something else was happening here? I understand it could also have been leaking around the mouth of the drain where the drain meets the tile. Either way, that would be a tiles not being sealed well issue, right?
2. Do I need to consider replacing my drain, or is it likely fine? One thing I've done, before ripping up all the tile, was to pour copious amounts of water straight down the drain, and I've had no issues with water leakage below. I really do believe water that gets INTO the drain is fine. I think it's just that I had water getting through the tile / base and coming down the side of this drain, but if I were to have new tile with new grout, and a new moisture barrier / membrane on top of this... is my drain likely good to keep as-is? Or is it one of those things where, since I've gotten this far, I should look into getting the drain out? I don't really want to do it ""just because I've come this far,"" but I also don't want to NOT do it, if it really needs to happen. If you think this thing is just so old and it's likely compromised in ways that I'm not realizing and it needs to go... let me know.
3. This leads to my another BIG question... where do I go from here as far as getting ready to put tile back on? I have done some research about using either a liquid membrane like RedGuard or one of the waterproof membrane ""rolls""... but is that something I could apply on top of this existing base (shown in image #1), or do I need to consider removing ALL of this old base and getting down to my subfloor. My thought has been that most of this material is in tact and solid, except where it was damaged on the right side, so perhaps I should build on top of this layer. In other words, get my subfloor dried out and patched up, then fill in the chunk that I've taken out (with what, some type of mortar mix?), and THEN use this as my base layer that I start rebuilding tile? And if so, what do you recommend doing next? Do I apply a waterproof layer on top of this, and then some sort of prefab shower tray (like Schluter Kerdi) on top of a thinset mortar, then put more thinset mortar and tile? The biggest issue with this layer currently is that it's not perfectly smooth since the tile pulled up some of this layer with it and it's a bit splotchy. Does it make more sense to NOT use a prefab tray, and to just refinish this layer with some type of overlay (keeping in mind the pitch, etc.), and then waterproof it and tile it? Or is that prefab tray a good way to go just because it has the right pitch, it's made of a good material, etc. I know that's a lot of questions, but hopefully my general question makes sense: how do I get from where I am now in these pictures to a place that is ready to tile?
4. Obviously, if I do use this base layer as my foundation on which I'm going to re-tile, and if I do build on this layer just a little bit with waterproof membrane, mortar, etc., then my new tile is going to be raised slightly higher than my old tile, which will make it hard to seal around my drain. Do I consider something like one of these ""extend o-drain"" [kits](https://www.amazon.com/Extendo-O-Drain-Extend-O-Drain-4-3-8/dp/B007BV6ED8/ref=asc_df_B007BV6ED8/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198111101494&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14607906552616376246&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012564&hvtargid=pla-351737196878&psc=1) that raises my drain by 1/4 inch, or is that a poor solution? Do we just go back to point #2 and say, you need to replace your drain. If I do need to go this route of replacing the drain, any kits you would point me to that make this easy, or is this definitely a ""call a plumber"" step? I recognize that removing the current drain might be tricky, even though I do have access from below as you can see from picture 4.

Any other major tips or pointers you would give me? Any videos that are a must watch? I've done a good bit of research, but wanted to be able to ask about my specific situation since I am a bit out of my league, so thanks in advance for any input!

Bathroom Vent Fan Leaking Water Question,2,3,"Hi,

I have a bathroom vent fan leaking water during certain conditions and I'd like to know how to fix it. 

The vent opens on a north facing roof. And it is on a slope. The water drips back in the vent fan on the second floor when there is snowfall and then warms up and melts. As winter progresses it will also happen after a shower and the steam is vented up the same fan. 
It is only during these conditions that there is water dripping back in.

I had someone come in and make sure the vents were connected to the vent caps through the attic and it appears the seals are ok. The insulation around the bathroom fan and the attic seems to be adequate too.

Visual inspection of the roof from thr ground appear to have snow built up around the vent cap. The snow doesn't melt properly due to location, angle of roof, some other cause??????? I don't know. What else could be causing this to happen under the environmental conditions described.  I should also say during summers with rainfall nothing out of order happens. 

My question is what is it? How can I get it fixed? What DIY stuff could I do? 

Thanks"

Help with a weird leak,0,3,"I have an upstairs bathroom with dual vanity sinks

We noticed a light switch (not the light but the switch) dripping water downstairs in the laundry room which is under this bathroom. Underneath this light switch seems to be a clean out area for the drains. I assume upstairs water drains down a pipe in this wall 

With no water running there is no leak downstairs

With water running to the left faucet, shower, or toilet there is no leaking

With the right faucet running there is a quick spurt of water into the electrical box downstairs

The thing is the right vanity has no obvious leak under the vanity or around the vanity

Im assuming there is some leak in the drain pipe for the right vanity as it travels downstairs behind the light switch but I assumed the left vanity and the right vanity had the same connected drainage. But there is no leak with the left vanity

New dark grey grout has chalky/white finish. How to proceed?,1,3,"Hey all,

So I've been researching this topic and it seems to be a fairly common issue when applying dark color grout. I have not sealed after grouting yet (I did seal the porous tiles before grouting with 511 impregnateor).

I just did the grout yesterday and today it's pretty dark in some places and basically chalky white in a lot of the other ones. I'm not sure how it got to this (most likely too wet of a cleanup sponge?) but I'm trying to fix this!

Does anyone have suggestions on what to do? The tiles are white with a 1/8th inch dark grey grout line. I have not sealed yet. Is there a product to use to help clean this up or am I totally screwed?

Thank you so much!"

Should i remove insulation from the inside of my masonry century home.,1,13,"I just purchased an 1888 Victorian style home in northern utah.  one of the things that attracted me to it, other than the price, was that it had 10 foot ceilings hidden behind dropped ceilings.  i knew this because in some places the ceiling was dropped with commercial style boards. some spots were dropped with drywall on top of some other type of board that resembles ceiling tiles. 

i knew i would remove the drop ceilings throughout the home to get the lost space back.  what i didnt expect to find is that the home had all of the exterior walls framed out and batt insulation installed. the insulation only goes as high as the drop ceiling or a foot above with vapor barrier between the insulation and drywall. in areas where the ceiling is dropped with drywall, there are insulation batts above.  

everything ive read about masonry buildings says that insulating on the inside is a huge no-no because it causes freeze thaw cycles that damage the bricks.  the home was wrapped in aluminum siding, likely before the insulation retrofit.  so i cant inspect the bricks from the outside without significant cost.

the question is, do i take down the insulation to prevent further damage or leave it and hope that the home doesnt fall over?"

How to deal with friable chyrsotile asbestos in the air?,6,16,"My parents home has friable chrysotile asbestos floating in the air. They had a close family member remove their popcorn ceiling who definitely didn't go about it properly.

I plan to rent a HEPA air scrubber (Dri-Eaz F284) to remove as much of the particles as possible. I know negative air pressure is used to prevent asbestos fibers from contaminating other areas during removal. But if removal and contamination has already occurred, is creating a negative air pressure environment still necessary? Can I just let the air scrubber run without setting up a negative air pressure?

Any advice on how to deal with this would be appreciated! I'm also planning to wet wipe hard surfaces and use a RRP certfied vacuum (Vacmaster VK811PH) on any carpet."

How long do pressure treated deck boards take to shrink to final size?,5,15,"TL;DR - Decking lumber sat in garage about a month and then out on deck for a few weeks before being installed. I still installed them very close because I didnt want large gaps once they shrink down to size. Now Im worried I should have left larger gaps since they had already partially dried. Help!

This summer I started restoring our ~350 sq ft deck. I decided to remove all the decking, which was 2x4 boards with huge gaps between each. This part of the project took a while because I was saving each board and removing all the nails to reuse them for garden carpentry type of jobs. I also did the same for the railings. The frame was in good enough shape to use again. Came to be that the joists were around 30 apart so I needed to put them in between. 

I ordered my lumber, pressure treated pine, and had it all delivered at the beginning of August. I installed the joists and used a stain and sealer on the parts I was keeping after sanding and power washing. By the time I was ready to lay decking my job as a teacher had started again as well as grad school. 

By the time I got to start installing the decking last week, some boards had been out on the deck waiting to be installed for a couple weeks. I installed them close (about 1/16), but some touch in areas. Im afraid I wont get a big enough gap now. Ive read about wood being so wet its oozing when you put a screw in it. That wasnt the case for me. Im about half way done and am looking for advice before I start the half that requires cuts to fit around posts and the house. Should I go back and give them more space? Like 1/8? Or am I good and they will still shrink enough to give me the gaps I want? We hated the huge gaps in the original deck and wanted to avoid that.  EDIT: I live in Pennsylvania. It was a usual humid and hot end of summer. Now the temps and humidity are quickly dropping since its fall. 

Thanks in advance for your advice!"

Custom desk build question,3,10,"Hey DIY-ers! I have a few newbie questions for you. I am working on a custom desk for my PCs. I have been liking and researching the builds with filing cabinets as supports (all the IKEA ones). My problem is, I need a long desktop (10ft). 

So my thought was, what about a laminate sheet (like this onehttps://www.homedepot.com/p/Wilsonart-3-ft-x-10-ft-Laminate-Sheet-in-Coffee-Bean-with-Standard-Matte-Finish-D4956035036120/203381748)? Or would that be too rough at the edge where my arms would rest? There's none available at hardware stores near me to check them out in person. They have the cut laminate ones, but they are all patterned and I'd rather have a solid color.

Also for that length, would you suggest a middle support of some kind? I am considering just doing three filing cabinets with one in the middle kind of separating the stations anyways. 

Bear in mind for all this I do not have fancy tools (yet, just bought my house lol) so I am working with a power drill and that's about it for nice tools X D

I really appreciate any input, thank you!"

Easy privacy shutters for bathroom window made from painted rulers and pvc pipe,8,2,"Ive had this up for almost 2 years already. 
Wanted to share my [diy privacy shutters ](https://imgur.com/a/yROmokH) which is my solution to a window that is placed at chest level right in our shower area. The shutters allow us to keep the window open but also provide us privacy. We keep the shower window open at all times to promote airflow and prevent moisture and mold since the previous owners did not install an exhaust fan (probably because they chose a window instead?) the other bathroom doesnt have a window but does have a fan. A curtain would be the immediate solution for privacy but it would constantly be wet. The perimeter is made out of  pvc pipes and elbows connected to fit the inside of the window. Make sure to take in your measurements to account for when the elbows slide into the pipe. That shortens your measurements. I didnt account for that and only measured the Full length of each of the pieces and forgot that It still has to slide into the elbow and I will lose some inches. .....but in the end I got lucky and it still fit. It was good anyway because since it was smaller, I was able to wiggle it in diagonally when assembled and I also made it shorter than the actual opening so that It can stand upright as I slide the window close on top of it to hold it in place. I drilled holes along the sides of the pipe and these are where the pins go. I took Home Depot rulers and cut them to size by assembling the frame first and then measuring from one end of the inner perimeter to the other end  and used that measurement to cut the rulers. This also makes sure there are no big gaps at the top of the rulers when installed. Then I coated them with white water resistant paint- similar to what they use on bathroom walls- I think spray paint would have been easier. I did 2 coats by hand and that was the longest part. One thing I would suggest is that the rulers that are on either end closest to the vertical pvc frames should be wider or fatter because the elbows prevent it from swinging fully closed so there is a larger gap. Maybe super glue two rulers together at the edges to make a wider one for those ends? I hammered some stainless steel nails to both of the  edges of the ruler leaving a big portion of it sticking out so it can be inserted into the holes you made in the pvc pipes. Since the ruler is so slim you want the thinnest nails so you dont split the ruler when you nail it in. The rulers swing around if you want to open them or close them by hand exactly  like shutters. Just make sure when you are measuring where to put the holes in the pipe that the rulers lay slightly on top of the other as to prevent huge gaps where people can peek through when you put it in the closed position. To assemble the rulers I first put all the pins on the top side then I lined up the pins on the bottom and I closed the pipes together. This was tricky since there are a lot of holes and pins and lining up. I recommend a second person to help.

Important: People recommended that I install an actual exhaust fan since airing moisture out with a window is inefficient. So please dont do this if ur only trying to exhaust a bathroom. If you like to shower with the window open but want some privacy and have extra airflow then this can be good for you. Note that I also live in Southern California where keeping the window open is not a huge issue all year round."

DIY Miniature tensile testing machine,37,9,"Hi Everyone, 

I was suggested to share my machine here, so I do it. 

[Miniature tensile testing machine](https://i.redd.it/exr702hz3kq31.png)

During the last 1.5-2 years I was working on a miniature tensile testing machine in my free time. During my job, I work a lot with materials testing and I've always been interested in tinkering, so this project is a good combination of everything. Originally, I started to work on this project, because I was working with a machine which had a very poorly written software and I was not satisfied with it. Also, the mechanics of that device was a bit poorly designed. So, I though, I could improve this. The presented project is still under development, but the machine is already fully functional and works quite well. 

At this moment, there are two big challenges. Firstly, I have to solve the problem with the displacement measurement. For some reasons, the caliper picks up some noise and I could not find the source of it so far. Whenever I connect the power supply to the controller of the stepper motor, the numbers on the display of the caliper go crazy. I tried different stepper drivers, different power supplies, but nothing helped so far. I still haven't tried to power the caliper from a separate PSU, so I have to check it. But I suspect, that the noise comes from somewhere else. Maybe I should shift the logical level of the caliper as close as possible to the PCB of the caliper and carry the already shifted signal to the Arduino. As you see it now, the signal from the caliper is carried to the main box (with a shielded cable) and the level is shifted there. I also have a plan B. I recently bought a DRO scale. I have to figure out how to read the signal of it with Arduino (I just recently received it, so I haven't really checked anything) and maybe it will be a better solution. Also, it is more robust, so it should work better with this machine.

Secondly, I want to compress the device into a more compact format. There are already plans for this, but I am very busy and I am also a bit short on resources (for example, CNC and other stuff). I show a 3d-printed part in the video which I use to hold the shafts and bearings. That would be one idea to make it more compact. However, I started to design something with individual bearings and L-shaped profiles. But I still have to make some drawings, measurements, and some preliminary assembly to see how I can implement the new design. 

[Sketch of the L-profile-based power transmission \(gears and shafts\)](https://i.redd.it/gjfta2114kq31.jpg)

I made a video for you guys, because it is more easy to explain it by speaking than writing a novel. And it is also better to see the actual parts that I talk about.[Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSf6cwc6GtI&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m&index=2&t=0s)

This is a closeup video of a sample and at the same time you can see the evolution of the tensile curve:

[Testing of a steel sample (closeup view)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNz2B1gsjtY&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m&index=4&t=0s)

I also have a series of videos, where you can follow the project from the first iteration. [Playlist for the whole project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSf6cwc6GtI&list=PLaeIi4Gbl1T9_tOk-mwGmbdWcfcrAMq4m)

I was asked for the parts, so this is the list with an approximate price in USD. Not all, but all the main components are on the list.

\- Base plate (laser cut, custom design) - $35

\- NEMA23 15:1 stepper motor - $75

\- TB6600 stepper motor driver - $10

\- Digital caliper - $8

\- Circuits for caliper (DC-DC converter, level shifter) - $3, $2

\- GX16 connectors (3,4 and 5 poles) - $10

\- 5 kN load cell - $62

\- EK08 support bearing (for the shaft for the worm gears) - 2 x $13

\- Crosshead pieces (laser cut, custom design) - 6 x $7

\- 1M-20T worm gear set (gear and wheel) - 2 x $12

\- Twin lead screw with nuts - 2 x $ 42

\- Custom made grips (CNC, custom design) - 2 x $53

\- Pillow bearings - 2 x $2.65

\- BK10 support bearing (main bearings for the lead screws) - 2 x $12

\- Arduino and other circuits (Uno, Nano, HX711) - $3, $2, $1.2

\- Power supply - $15

\- Plastic box - $8

\-------------------------------------

Sum \~ $550

But, this is a very rough estimate since the price of the custom made parts can vary. I also haven't considered the cost of the tools and small parts that I already had at home or I actually had to buy. Small screws, spare parts, wires, soldering stuff, etc. Furthermore, the hours I spent on design, programming, assembling and disassembling this several times, etc. The reality is more close to $1000 if you want to buy everything from a proper seller and in high quality. I bought most of the stuff from China from random sellers from Alibaba (In fact, I am very satisfied with them and those products), and from other, mostly Chinese websites. The system is capable of measuring much larger forces (about 20 kN) easily, but based on the current load cell, I am limited to 500 kg. It is really difficult to find cheap and small load cells with higher capacity. 

I am still working on this machine and hopefully I will be able to turn it into a nice product at the end. The programming part is about 90% done (some improvement can be done, and I want some more, fancy features), so most of the work should be done on the mechanical part. I will do more tests with different materials in the future and I will also publish them as videos."

Which type of unvented gas heater is best for an unfinished basement? (infrared or convection),2,4,"I say unvented because it will not be an always-on heater. Basement stays 55F-65F on coldest days with no heat. Occasionally I will need it to be more comfortable for using the shower down there. I know infrared is a more comfortable heat to feel, but I think it is best when it is spread out rather than concentrated in a single spot. My problem with it is that the gas hookup for it is around 30' from the bathroom. I'm thinking convection might be better for heat dispersal.  

I currently heat the house with a gas furnace, and there are 2 vents down there already. Would it make more sense economically to just open those vents, and/or add 2 more?"

Retractable Tennis Ball Stopper - Cord Length,2,2,"Hi,

&#x200B;

Today I installed a fixed length tennis ball stopper in the garage. Some yt videos suggest to make it a retractable stopper by connecting the cord with the upper end of the garage door (e.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0695k47QTdY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0695k47QTdY) ), which looks very neat.

Since our car has a windshield at a height closer to the ceiling than in most of those videos (tennis ball hangs at lowest point possible w.r.t the windshield) what happens when I hook the cord to the garage door is that the ball gets pushed all the way in to the ceiling before the door reaches the final position.

How can I implement a simple mechanical solution that helps alleviate this issue. I dont want to add any further arms or stiff extensions to the garage door, but rather simply work with the cord itself and maybe a more intelligent way to route the cord along the ceiling."
Overhead garage shelving into a steel framed home.,1,1,"My first DIY post, I'm not certain about posting of pictures and formatting, so bear with me.  


https://i.redd.it/ynmfn5u9egq31.jpg

I was looking to get overhead storage for my garage, but all of the ""DIY"" kits state that they are not to be used with steel framed homes. I suppose this is because the hardware only uses lag bolts designed for wood. I decided I would take a chance at installing my own system. I used Plus-Nuts to hold channel struts into the ceiling, and then hung wire framed shelving with 1/2"" threaded rod.

My procedure was as follows: Obtain home blueprints. Discover house has 16"" on center metal joists for ceiling. Determine that spare 18"" X 48"" shelves will space across 3 joists for bolts

Actually measure joists: Use stud finder to locate joists, Note that that every 12 feet doubled studs are used. Also note that 16"" on center was most likely just a ""suggestion"" spacing varies from 13"" to 18"".

Actually measure shelves: Discover that shelves are 16.5"" and 46.5"" on center for mounting holes. Also, determine that garage door will only allow 16"" of drop down from ceiling.

Rework plans...

New plans call for 3 channel struts over the car parking area, parallel to how car is parked

Center strut will hold one side of all shelves, side channels will hold other side.

Shelves will be staggered to allow clearance for removal of boxes.

Locate each stud center. Drill 1/8th inch starter hole, Expand to 1/4"" hole, then use Hole Saw to cut out 2"" diameter circle. 2"" diameter used to allow for head of Plus-Nut tool. I used the step drill to open the hole up more and then finished with the Plus-Nut specified 31/64th inch drill bit. Drilling inverted (especially with the step drill) knocks out big shards of metal that will burn bare skin, wear safety googles, a long sleeve shirt, and maybe even a scarf to protect your neck.

Place laser level on ground to provide guides on where additional holes are to be drilled. Then pencil out lines and double check distances. Triple check distances and then start drilling additional holes.  
After holes are drilled and Plus-nuts installed, measure solid channel for matching holes. Use step drill to open up each hole to 1/2"" diameter. This allows a little ""wiggle room"" for inserting the 5/16th inch bolts with washers.  
Install channel with two bolts and washers in the center, then add other bolts along the length of the channel. I did this by myself, putting the first two bolts in with just a few turns, then lining up the other bolts, and finally tightening the whole channel down. Total of 9 bolts for a 10' section of channel. Each 5/16 Plus-Nut is rated for 125lbs of pull out force.   


Shelves were installed with the 1/2 channel nuts and 1/2 threaded rod (cut to 16"" lengths). I used washers and nuts to secure the tops and bottoms of all the rods.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/e5uuxn7segq31.jpg

After installation, I was able to hold on to the shelves and bounced up and down (160 pounds), and nothing moved at all. The center strut holds 5 shelves, (see top picture) and if everything was loaded to max shelf capacity of 300 lbs, this would be 1500 lbs. of weight for the 3 channels. Add the other side, and that is 3000 lbs. Currently, the shelves are holding about 500 lbs combined weight. Mostly Christmas decorations, and other large but light things.

Observations:   
Flanged bolts were most likely unnecessary, standard 5/16 hex bolts would have worked fine, especially with the 5/16 washers.  
A DIY tool for installing Plus-Nuts and Riv-Nuts is available on YouTube: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel7FllhxJM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cel7FllhxJM) and it can save you money.  
Slotted channels most likely would have worked fine, as well as being cheaper and lighter.  
1"" hole saw would have been sufficient to allow Plus-Nut installation tool.  
I originally considered cutting 2"" diameter pieces of wood to use as spacers for the holes in the overhead sheetrock, but this did not end up being needed.  
I used the Ultra-Saw my wife bought me for cutting the threaded rods and channels, but a hacksaw would work in a pinch.  
I should have gotten more pictures of the channels being drilled and installed, as well as cutting the threaded rods to size.

Question:   
How is the weight capacity calculated for a metal trussed ceiling span of 20 feet, when it is spread across 8 regular beams and one doubled up beam? My Mother-In-Law's room is above the garage, and she might be a little upset if the floor collapses on her."

Problem with a new radiant heat install,3,3,"Hello all,

Image of my setup: [https://imgur.com/gallery/dnzFRfI](https://imgur.com/gallery/dnzFRfI)

My kitchen flooded back in February and I decided to completely gut it as it could have been a set on That 70's Show. As part of the renovation I decided to put in radiant floor heat under my tile. I did a bunch of research on them back when I decided to do it (March) and have just now finished plumbing it in.

The rest of my house is heated with a gas fired boiler going to the baseboards. I plumbed the new radiant system into this with a mixing valve to bring the heat down to 120 ([https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free](https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free)).

I'm having two issues right now.

1. How can I make the circulator for the radiant fire only when the Radiant thermostat calls for heat? I put the baseboard thermostat on Zone 4 as this Taco 404 controller is supposed to only trigger the end switch when a zone except 4 is calling for heat, but that doesn't seem to be working. I don't want to make the radiant my priority zone because I plan to add more zones in the future as I'm working on the house.
2. The circulator doesn't seem to be pumping correctly, is the turn too close to the output of the pump? I know I was reading that there's supposed to be 12"" of pipe before the circulator, not sure about after. I'm not seeing any GPM on the flow gauges on the supply lines. Just FYI the shutoffs connecting to the boiler supply and returns were open during testing, I've since disconnected the circulator and shut them off so I can run the baseboard heat until I figure it out. Status lights on the circulator are on and I can hear it, so it should be pumping.

I can work around #1 right now by swapping the radiant to the priority zone and using that end switch so that's not as big of an issue right now, but I'd appreciate any comments that can help with that. My big problem right now seems to be with getting flow through the system. That's a variable speed Taco pump ([https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump](https://www.pexuniverse.com/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump)) as I planned on adding more zones in the future, so it should be able to handle it on max load but I'm seeing nothing.

Oddly enough, I get more heat on the supply side than through the mixing valve. I'm thinking I need to add a check valve on the return as I was seeing 120 at the return and 70 at the supply.

I appreciate any advice y'all can give me as to how to solve these issues or how I may have messed up the plumbing!"
Botched strand bamboo install - how to repair?,3,9,"I had strand bamboo installed by what turned out to be a pretty crappy ""company."" They used 18 gauge cleats for the tongue and groove solid strand bamboo flooring. This was installed in my living room and kitchen on my main floor (basement below) onto plywood subfloor. 

The flooring was properly weathered and I made very sure they used the cleats specified by the manufacturer. 

In one spot, the planks have ""tented."" They have pushed into one another and can easily be pushed down with a foot. Now, I've checked and checked for any signs of moisture, swings in humidity, etc. and haven't found anything that leads me to believe this is an issue. I've also removed my baseboards and the floor has plenty of room to contract/expand. 

I'm kind of left clueless on what is causing this. My theory is that the installers didn't use enough cleats in the installation. I had a ""flooring expert"" come out to look and he also seemed to think the boards weren't properly nailed down.

So I'm wondering if my theory even makes sense or if it's something else and wanting to know what my options are. Could I potentially face nail the problem spot down? I wouldn't mind some damage to the face as ripping up the 600 sqft space and restarting would be a large expense. 

Would love your thoughts!"

Here\^  are pics of the battery and the connections inside the tool. As far as  constructing a holder with identical connections, I can do that without  help. After that though, I am in the dark.

I  have a good multi meter and I've been planning on buying a nice  soldering kit. (would love some suggestions) I know I need a wall plug  cord and some little tabs, similar to the ones in the 3rd pic(know a  good place to find that kind of stuff?). Other than that, what would I  need? Any and all help is appreciated, Thanks for your time!"
A Regular Guy Makes Built-In Cabinetry,24,17,"Longtime lurker first time DIY poster. I've truly learned a lot and found a lot of inspiration here, so I hope that my post helps someone, even if it's just an ""oh man, I would NOT do it that way"".

[The goods](https://imgur.com/a/NaK8HZ6)

Some additional detail:

* I am not a professional at this in any way (which you are fully aware of if you looked at the album already), but I do have a lot of DIY home improvement experience and a more full set of tools than average (maybe not the average r/DIY'er, but the average person). My day job is software dev.
* This project was completed entirely by me with zero help. Not that I asked, just saying it could have gone faster and had fewer errors with a helping hand or two. Being a large, fit human really enabled me to do a lot of things that would have otherwise required helpers. Don't be like me, ask your friends for help, feed them and have a beer with them after, improve your relationship.
   * Note: normally my wife is very involved in our house projects and is a total badass at it, but since she was (and still is) pregnant throughout the course of this project, we wanted her nowhere near: power tools, wood and mdf dust, paint fumes, strenuous lifting, etc. She's not getting out of caulk duties though...
* It took me about 10-12 FTE days, spread out over 6mo (including a 2mo break for sanity)
* I didn't keep detailed records, but I budgeted for $600 and came in around $500 (I expected to ruin more wood stock). A contractor buddy of mine estimated this project at about 3k to be done professionally. I am unsure that's accurate, but I don't have a better guess."

Im building an induction heater and button isnt working,1,12,"Im building an induction heater and Im currently testing out my button. Its a push button thats supposed to stay on while I have it held down and then turn off once I let go. Its connected to a 12v power supply and the induction heater is also a 12v.

As far as wiring goes, I have the blue wire connected to the red wire, which the red one is connected to the positive terminal of the induction heater. The black wire is connected to the brown wire, which the brown one is connected to both negative terminals of the induction heater and the power supply adapter. The white wire is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply adapter.

The issue is when I press the button, the LED turns on and then immediately turns off again both on the button and the induction heater. I have the wiring in their correct terminals with positive and negative, but Im not sure what could be the issue here. Ive also tried a second induction heater to rule it out as being the issue. The only thing I see that could be the issue is when I press the button, the power supplys led turns off. Is it a bad power supply thats causing this? I dont have a second one at the moment to test this out.

Need advice. First time making a sunken fire pit. Lots of questions.,2,4,"[pictures for reference](https://imgur.com/a/EqHL5kw) My roommate has a wood shop in our garage but hes just starting out and never made anything this big before. I know first I have to ask the city if there are any pipes below the dig site. Ive watched a couple of diy videos on how to build wooden retaining walls and it says something about putting down paper then a drain pipe then backfill with gravel. What do I do with the hole at the end? Where should that point to? (Pics or drawings would be helpful. I am a visual person.) I need to know exactly where do I need to put that (around in a u shape along the edge? or if I can just get by with gravel? I was thinking of using the planter wall blocks from Home Depot to build the planters on the ground level that also acts as a backrest. The seats would be level to the actual ground so I only need to be digging so that from the height of the seat to the floor is about 12 to 15 inches. What do i do first? Put down an outline  so that I know where Im digging then digging (how wide do I dig?) then I have to level the soil. then put down paper? Do I need sand or gravel or just a leveled soil? Then do I start putting in my planter wall blocks and planks? Do I need to glue the planks together or just slipping them in through the blocks would be ok? For the actual top part- do I need to add support to the inside of the planters so that I can support a human on it? What kind of support? What about just square frames that I can place inside every couple of inches? For the top part of the bench do I glue the wood to the concrete blocks? What kind of glue? What screws do I need to screw it in to the top part of the planks? It will be exposed to the sun a lot and rain and moisture- What kind of stain , paint or finish is best? What kind of wood? 
Building the fire pit part. I want to also use wood to surround it. What inner lining is best? Bricks? What do I put under? Gravel? Then bricks? Recommendation for a gas pit maybe that I can just buy and put in there? Something with an edge to our drinks on.  I need it to be square or rectangular. 
As for laying down the posts to put up some sail shade do I just dig then pour concrete while the post is in there? How far do I have to dig? Would it also hold up a hammock? Any other ideas or detailed help would be awesome."

Redoing deck stairs and have a question,1,5,"So I am nearing the end of my deck resurfacing and have to replace the stringers for me deck. In the process of finding out what should be done per code I am reading confusing things when it comes to the landing.

Per my county's code it states:

     STAIR LANDING
      If the total vertical height of a stairway exceeds 12 feet, 8 1 4"" max. riser 3 4"" - 11 4"" nosing 4"" diameter sphere shall not pass tread 9"" min. tread riser  
      Stair landings may be constructed with 4x4 posts with post heights no greater than 8 feet.
      Landing widths shall be equal to the total width(s) of the stairway(s) served. 

However, everywhere else I read talks about needing to be solid, and able to measure the slope of the surface so gravel isn't an option. Right now there are 3 stringers, the 2 outside ones are supported by 4x4 posts, however the middle on rests on the ground (barely). When I redo them I want  to make sure that there is zero issues with any inspections.

So do/should I do a concrete pad? Maybe just pavers? Digging down won't be an issue since I have a  tiller, but I'd rather not have to deal with 15 bags of concrete if I didn't have to.

Id prefer  not to use a drum sander if i dont have to it is a loooong way to home depot. but if that is an option that will work and i can rent  followed by an orbital and edger. Stain. Polyurethane. 
I don't want to pay to have this done which will probably get me some flak.

Question - How bad is installing duct work insulation and a crawl space?,4,4,"I was hoping to get the opinions of people here who have installed their own insulation in a crawl space.   Our house has an older AC/Heating system, and the insulation on the ductwork has been there for a while.  I noticed that there are some spots where it is in pretty bad shape, and has started drooping and falling off.  The ducts themselves look okay, but there are spots where the insulation will need to be replaced.

How painful is installation?  Is this something that is better left to the pros?  I would rather do this myself than hire someone in order to save some money, but don't want to dive in if it is going to be a horrible experience.   I got one quote for the work, and it came in at $700 which I thought seemed high for roughly 5-6 feet of insulation replacement."

What is the best way to reduce sound travel down hallway/stairwell so I don't hear sounds in bedroom?,2,11,"I just moved into a townhouse where my bedroom is directly on top of a straight staircase, and down the hall from the master bedroom. Sound seems to funnel into this room from both directions. The townhouse is all tall ceilings and entirely hardwood floors, so even a song played in the entryway on the first level from a cell phone can be clearly heard from this bedroom on top of the stairs. Similarly, music played in the master echos all the way to my room and downstairs into the living room. (Yet, in the master bedroom you can hear nothing from the rest of the house.) It seems to me that the issue is these long hallways reverberating this sound along white walls and hard floors, rather than sound leaking through the floor or ceiling.

What is the best way to significantly reduce this noise travel in the hallways? I have considered carpet runners, but I wanted to get feedback from someone on here before I make any expensive purchases. I'm skeptical that a thin carpet will make much of a difference. Are there possibly affordable sound panels?"

Mounting a T.V. and floating entertainment shelf. How should I go about setting up an outlet?,1,14,"[Here is a crudely drawn version of what the T.V. and entertainment shelf will look like mounted on the wall.](https://imgur.com/a/zYrrNvS)

From my understanding, it is against code in most areas to run high voltage (power) chords behind the wall. So I am guessing I will need to install an outlet behind the T.V. and possibly behind the floating shelf as well. This wouldn't be too big of an issue, but as you can see in the photo, the outlet dead center on the wall is a coax outlet. The only two outlets I have on this wall are both to right and left of the coax outlet. 

I would like to hide the wires behind the wall if possible, but given the circumstances I am unsure if I will be able to while also staying in code. I know I can connect a new outlet to an existing one, but I am also guessing trying to connect a new outlet dead center will be troublesome as the two available outlets are likely separated by several studs. 

If you have any recommendations or solutions please let me know. I am fairly new to this so if I absolutely need to hire someone or just deal with some visible wiring I have no problems doing so. Thank you all in advance.

Need to find a fabric covering and best way to enclose backyard - HELP Please,0,0,"Hello!

I'm trying to fix up my backyard so I don't have to keep raking it, we also have so many spiders that I can't go outdoors comfortably. It is an apartment, and we would also like to let our cat out back, so we'd like to enclose the backyard completely. But, I do have potted plants, so we can't use anything that would completely block out the sun. 

ALSO, our area is full of these aggressive mosquitos, so we would like to keep those out too. Also my fiance is 6 ft 4 in, and the top of the fence is only 6 ft, so we would need to attach something to the fence to keep it at least at 7 feet. 

We tried doing mosquito netting but it's way too loose, and I'm pretty sure I'm highly allergic since I STILL have hives on my hands. 

TLDR:

\- Need a fabric that keeps bugs and leaves out 

\- BUT needs to let sun in for the plants

\- Need tips on how to get it a foot higher than the fence, and how to attach to apartment

Neutral to Single Pole Setup,1,10,"Hey diy,

&#x200B;

Looking to add a neutral wire to my switch in a single-pole setup. It looks like the neutral goes to the light first, and then the white going to the switch from the light is actually 'hot', with the black wire going back being the load. I've read the following thread and post by /u/daole: [https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/5ma6ie/add\_neutral\_to\_wall\_switches/](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/5ma6ie/add_neutral_to_wall_switches/) (unfortunately archived and I can't reply there).

But essentially where I'm stuck at is this. I have into the fixture a white, black, ground. Black goes to white (wirenutted) and out to the switch, black back to the fixture. At the switch white goes to hot, black to load, and back out to the fixture into the load-in.

What I'm confused at is this: if I add 2 wires going from the switch to the fixture (white/red), at the fixture I pull the black wirenutted to the white apart and connect it to the old black (therefore, black will be hot at the switch, red will be load). Connect the red to the load on the fixture. Now at the fixture I will have 4 white wires (fixture to wirenut, white in from source, and 2 whites going to the switch receptacle), do I wirenut all 4 together? Then at the switch I will have 3 whites (switch to wirenut, 2 whites going to the fixture receptacle), do I wirenut all 3 together?

Seems to me I wouldn't really need to bring in 2 new wires, all I really need is 1 new red wire from switch to light fixture, but I guess we run the full 3 wires because they come sheathed together?

I've searched for hours to find diagrams but unfortunately there's no single pole diagram that starts at the light and passes neutral to the switch (that I can see anyway).

Thank you."

Concrete Spalling Repair - Help?,4,11,"Link to photo: https://imgur.com/Qx69977

Hi all! 

The entrance to the basement of my home has some unsightly concrete spalling. 

The drain is now higher than the spalling (and maybe was originally?), so after it rains water sits in the lowered space. 

I would like to repair the damaged area, making it level with the drain & finishing over top with an aesthetically pleasing product - maybe a waterproof epoxy grey finish? 

r/diy, how hard of a repair is this - for somebody who has never done concrete but is otherwise fairly handy? What would you do? 

As an aside - I am located in Alberta, Canada & we have very cold temperatures in the winter. 

Thank you for any insight!"

Help connecting clear panels for animal cage,0,12,"I want to make my pet mice an improved cage using some sort of clear paneling (acrylic, plastic, or plexiglass) I'm not sure how to connect these pieces. The difficulty is I need to take it apart weekly for cleaning and the spacing in between panels has to be non existent or negligible so the mice cant escape. I also need to have this be somewhat ventilated so the top needs to be relatively open but again, without a space large enough for them to escape. 

Notes: 
-will be drilling about a 2"" hole in the side of the enclosure for a tube leading to a second cage
-ventilation is key
-simple top that lifts off for easy cleaning would be great"

I have a couple of these mounted to the wall with drywall screws. When I pull out a cord there's a good chance I will pull the strip off the wall. It's annoying. Is there a trick to getting these things to stay on the wall? I like not having exposed screws, so a strip with mount points on the side isn't what I'm looking for. I have found that the 3M Command strips aren't strong enough to resist the force used when pulling a plug out all of the time."

How do I approach adding artwork to a guitar body that has an acrylic finish?,1,10,"My dad is working on a guitar gift for a singer friend and asked me to do the art (mostly because he's unwilling to pay a professional). I am an experienced artist but i'm finding this not to be very simple. I thought he'd had just a base coat put on an unfinished body, but instead he just bought a guitar with a fully finished acrylic seal in the color he wanted. 

Not a great start, but I'm wondering if this is still something I can work out. He just wants a simple leaf pattern painted on the edge of the face that we can then finish to protect it. 

Is there a way to do this over the acrylic finish and have it work and not look like shit or is he asking too much? I worry about stripping the finish (if that's even possible) because it could destroy the color and I've got no experience doing that or putting a new finish over the art. I'm curious what options (paint, decal, etc)  are there to get this artwork on the guitar the way he wants it."

Help fitting Beading/Scotia laminate floor,1,2,"Been trying to fit Scotia after fitting laminate flooring past couple days and I can't seem to get the cut right.

I've tried that and end up with a gap about 5mm at the bottom when against the wall so the pieces are not matching up. Any help would be appreciated. 

I've measured the angle of the corner and it appears to be almost bang on 90 degrees. 

I've been using a protractor by drawing the angle across the scotia and a coping saw to cut and now I'm going to get a mitre box to see if that helps?

If I put the pieces together they match up but as soon as I put them against the wall the top meets but the bottom doesn't. 

Any tips would be helpful.

Problem is I don't have a lot of space between the bottom of porch and ground so an auger is out.

Help Making Fake Leaves for Korok Costume,2,1,"Hey Y'all,

I was thinking of sandwiching small gage wire between 2 green plastic sheets to create the vain effect..then using paint to color. 

Thoughts? Suggestions? What type of plastic? Or is there a fabric I should use instead? I've also seen paper leaves.

The rest of the costume is based on a morph suit that will be colored to match korok patterns.

Screwed up Pergo flooring - but how badly?,4,6,"First time installing Pergo Outlast. I go on their website and in big letters, says NO UNDERLAYMENT, because it already has underlayment attached.

Friends, how bad did I screw up? The concrete is one foot thick so the building is well off the ground on a thick slab. I live in a place that rarely rains. How much mold and air quality damage am I looking at, and how quickly? It does have underlayment... just no vapor barrier.

If the cost is $1k to tear the floor out and put in the moisture barrier, should I just keep it as-is for the next 5 years and pick some random time to take it out? Or just bite the bullet now?"

How do I tile this wall?,4,9,"Hi DIY,

I intend to tile 1 entire wall (4' x 8') of my bathroom \[remodel\] with this glass/stone mosaic stuff.

The wall is drywall with new Kilz primer applied.  This tile wall will sit behind the toilet and vanity.

1. Do I start the sheets at the bottom center?  Or at 1 corner?
2. I know that I can cut out pieces of tile from the mesh with a knife - to work around the 3 water supply pipes and the light fixture.  But what about when I want to install shelves or a towel hanger later?  Is it common to drill holes into this stuff?

FWIW,  I have a good wet saw for this job.

Help revamping old bathroom shower area,1,5,"  

Our home was built in the 40s. Plaster walls, I've been told, on which was old plastic tile, which I pulled off, removing the remaining adhesive with a heat gun.

Tore down the tub surround to reveal the same adhesive/tile pattern as was on the walls. There's clearly been some repairs done as seen in the pictures. 

I wanted to cut down to the studs, put up cement backerboard with Redgard, and then tile. I've been advised that getting the plaster down to the studs is going to be a right bitch, or at least a huge mess.

Does this look like it'd be OK to tile over? This is my first DIY project. No idea how to deal with the patched-up areas, and really, no idea what I'm doing in general.

Thanks in advance.

Installing a Framed Sliding Shower Door: Tips Before I Start?,5,8,"Hellooo friends! I have an alcove shower with a curb in my master bath. The previous owner ripped out the tub to turn it into a standing shower but didn't install a door. Unfortunately having a curtain there doesn't help with the water escaping so I have to install a door. I am eyeballing framed shower door kits and it's looking like a pretty easy install based on the How-To videos I've been watching. 

The only part I worry about is drilling into the tile on the wall. Currently I have a Craftsman drill (seen below), does it need a special tile drill-bit to make the hole for the screw? Im worried about cracking the tile and having to re-tile the whole damn shower if I mess this up.

What's the most efficient way to fix the monitor stand I just built?,1,9,"I just built a monitor stand a few days ago, and the top is bowing due to the weight of my monitor (\~20 lbs). 

I'll replace the top with thicker wood. However, is 20 pounds heavy enough that I should plan to support the top more? If so, what's the best way to go about doing that? 

Here is how the stand is currently constructed:

1. Top is plywood 9 x 15 x 0.5
2. Four legs 4"" tall (made out of 3/4"" wood)
3. Left side - there's a connector a little under 8"" long (also made out of 3/4"" wood). Same deal on the right side. 
4. I laid loose dowels over each 8"" long connector to give my laptop a ventilated shelf (I'll secure these dowels down once I know how to fix the rest of the stand).

Repair drywall ceiling or replace,0,8,"Large drywall ceiling had a slow water leak above it for a few days while we were gone (caused by a contractor).  Water pooled within the seams of the drywall and spread out before they gave way to the water dripping to the floor.

The leak was stopped, but it sat for days while I tried to get the contractor to get his insurance involved.   Finally got mine involved instead, Servpro came and cut a hole and dried it up.  

My question is, do I just patch the hole Servpro cut or replace all the drywall where the seam sat wet?  The edges of the drywall there look to be discolored a bit and black in spots.  Worried it may be mold.  The face and backing of drywall look fine from what I can see through the hole above.  See photos:

https://imgur.com/gallery/n9AA1Hn

The tough choice for me is if I can patch it I can definitely do this myself.  If I should replace the full sheets then Ill need to hire someone, which is a real pain since this is considered a small job for the few Ive reached out to so far.  But willing to keep trying if I really should be replacing it all.

I have a stainless steel desk skeleton that I would like to ""transform"" into a copper one. I've asked online and on dedicated forums and the like on how I could possibly pull that off. 

The desk it self is made out of square steel piping which is 2 inch thick. And has the dimensions of 
W:1,40 m
H:0,80 m
D:0,85 m

Now what most of them suggested was to just paint it. But that I'm afraid will most likely not have the result I'm looking for as I am looking for the look of polished copper something that the paint will most likely not be able to replicate well. Another way I thought was to basically ""plate"" the steel with thin sheets of copper but that seems to me like an idea that's not exactly easy to put in practice + it costs quite a bit.

So I'm at the mercy of r/DIY for the help of fellow makers.

Advice Needed: Repurposing Towel Rod Under Kitchen Cabinet,0,5,"Context: We have been remodeling our bathroom, and removed a towel rod in the process. Rather than throwing it out, we are looking to repurpose it elsewhere in the apartment. We are hoping to hang it above our kitchen sink and use it as hanging storage for pots and pans.

The screws it came with are 1 1/4"" long, but the wood is only 1"" thick. We also want the cabinet to still be usable. What are the options here? Should we go with 1/2"" screws, or nuts & bolts? Do we need to use some kind of anchors? Any advice is greatly appreciated!

I taped wrapping paper over that just to make it look less sad.

Does anyone have a better idea? Or have a way of accomplishing this? Any suggestions? Im not good with interior design or DIY so Id be very grateful for any tips.

Thank you so much!

Edit: love the Velcro ideas, thank you! Were in a rental with concrete walls and will likely be moving in a year, so drilling and installing things is particularly a pain. I think Ill try Velcro for now. Thank you all!"
Junction box in attic,103,46,"I hope this isn't a stupid question.  I almost posted in the r/electricians page, seemed like a bad idea.  Anyway, home is located in Wisconsin I've been doing a lot of wiring in my house and in order to facilitate future splices for additional lights throughout the house, I wanted to install a junction box in the attic.  It's not covered with insulation, posing any hazard, etc.  I decided to start a new circuit for these lights. There is one hot line running into it directly from the panel and connected to one other light.  The intention is the have a good source to splice into run other lights from in the future.

&#x200B;

I am being told this is illegal and all junction boxes need to be accessible on the livable floor (for lack of better term).  Is this person confusing with simply having the box be accessible at all?  Because it is... I can't seem to find anything solid reflecting this language about unlawful attic j-boxes in the Wisconsin electrical code, but I'm not super well versed in this.

&#x200B;

TL;DR, I want to install a junction box in the attic. Is this legal or not?"
Vinyl plank flooring - how would you tackle this set-up?,149,92,"Hi All! Im about to undertake installing vinyl flooring planks in two rooms that connect to a tiled kitchen, separated by a marble threshold (Probably the click and lock floating variety vs loose lay). The dilemma I face is my home is very open concept and Im not sure how to handle this large room separation between kitchen and living room (1st pic). As you can see there is quite the height difference between the living room and kitchen, about 3/4 inch. (2nd and 3rd pic). Because its a floating floor I also know I cant have the floor push directly against the marble and will need to leave a gap (pic 4). Any ideas on how I can tackle this? Thanks!

Edit: I have 2 kids and normally a big dog. Our late Boxer is the reason Im changing from carpet in the first place :-) 

Edit 2: I now understand that most people say the right way to do this is to raise the floors, but I have 600 square feet between the 2 rooms and Im looking to avoid that by hacking another solution. Some awesome advice in this thread! 

Edit 3: okay okay...Im now considering raising the floor :-|

Looking for advice on installing a return in my basement duct-work.,5,3,"So I'm finishing my basement and it was suggested to install a return in the ceiling of the living room.  I've never taken on any projects involving HVAC equipment and I'm having a hard time finding any videos that are my particular situation.  I've attached pictures to show the setup. 

https://i.imgur.com/zhZpwNC.jpg

https://i.imgur.com/8budNYi.jpg

The length from the furnace to the end of the return duct is about 9.5 feet.  It was suggested by the gentleman finishing our basement to install the return at the end, but we had a HVAC company come out to give us a bid and he talked about adding an extension so it wasn't so close to the furnace.  The quote for just the return was $185.  

So my questions are:

* Is the return absolutely necessary?
* Is this a reasonable price?
* Is adding an extension necessary?
* Is this something a somewhat competent homeowner can tackle themselves?
* Would you suggest a good youtube video to help out?

Thanks!"

Splitting apart glued sistered rafters?,2,5,"I became the fortunate owner of a dozen brand-new 22' long 2x10 rafters, but they are sistered 2x10x16' with 2x10x10' each, with a 4' overlap (sistered) section.  The sistering was done with some serious screws and construction adhesive.  I want to split them with as little damage as possible.  I have removed the screws, and I tried separating one set, using a few chisles as wedges.  While I was technically successful, the glue did take a bit of the surface grain from each side with it (not to mention the gouge-channels the chisels made).  Is there a better, less damaging way to separate these boards?"
Can I drill a hole into a soffit to run the cable for a WiFi Camera?,2,10,"I'm interested in installing a WiFi Camera outside of my front door. My house has a brick wall and I do not want to drill a hole through the brick for the power cord (I'm fine with drilling the mount into the brick though). Above the front door is a soffit that provides ventilation for the attic. I have a power outlet in the attic that the power cord can reach. I would just need to drill a hole through the soffit to run the cable.

Is there any reason that drilling a hole through the soffit would be frowned upon? I want to make sure that I wouldn't be messing anything up by drilling through the soffit. I figured that it wouldn't be a problem since the soffit itself already has several small holes for ventilation as it is. Below are pictures of the front door and the soffit that I'm talking about. I would install the camera above the top right side of the front door.

[Plumbing] Trenching and 200 ft of PVC to new water service,88,45,"I'm in Eastern NC and a private water company is adding service to our neighborhood.

I'm looking to connect the house to their service. I want to keep my irrigation on the well, add a hose bib at the well, and move the tank (or possibly go to a smaller one) and pressure switch to the well from my garage.

The first estimate I got was $3500, which seems high to me.

In the event that this is what other companies are charging then I'm thinking about doing the trenching and line laying myself to start with and then decide on whether to try and push through the rest of the work out get a pro to finish.

I guess my initial question would be on using sch 40 versus something like PEX?  Seems like it would be easier to just unroll the PEX in the trench and be done with it?  Looks like the current line from the well is PVC. And I'm thinking 1.5"" line from the street. My house is 4 bdrm."

And after fulfilling these conditions, I will be able to receive financial support for holding free seminars for everyone.

"Trying to repair stuck wash machine, too eager",3,2,"Hi,

Found info and 75% sure I can fix my wash machine.

HOWEVER, early in the process of pulling apart my NA-series Panasonic machine, I got eager and pulled out the blue, plastic, main agitator / pulsator disc at the base.

The screw is about 1.25"" long (3cm?) with a rubber washer seal on it.
https://bigwarehousesparesaus.appspot.com/images/646676.jpg

Upon changing my mind and trying to put the screw back in, it would only go down about half way and stop.

Picture of it here.

https://i.imgur.com/armG6gP.png

So I guess maybe, the inside where the screw goes, got water inside it?   It appears to just be a screw holding the blue plate in 


https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7WgpMFpwymI/maxresdefault.jpg

Quite similar to this.

Have I got water, down a thin shaft and nuked my primary spinning motor or have I got water in a small cavity I just need to dry out, before putting the plate back in?   (Water being incompressible) 

(My concern is the rubber washer - telling me, water should probably not go down this hole and some did)




As for the actual non draining U11 code on the washer, I actually think I'll have that solved (Bra underwire was loose inside under that pulsator / agitator plate)


Thanks any and all, the internet is great sometimes."

Securing handrail posts into soil,6,4,"I'm looking at installing handrail in a family member's garden and could use some advice.

I'm planning to use kee klamp (or a knockoff version): https://simplifiedbuilding.co.uk/handrail/kee-klamp-handrail for the railing itself

Unfortunately, all the parts I've seen are for attaching it to a concrete path. There is a concrete path in the required location, but it is only 90cm wide, so I can't use it to fix the handrail posts without making it too narrow for bins / wheelchairs / etc.

Quick sketch:

https://imgur.com/a/6n5khXv

I have 9 posts that need to go into the ground. This is my current plan:

- I want 1m posts above ground, so I think burying 50cm should be enough. I'll therefore need 1.5m posts.
- The ground is fairly soft. I'm thinking I'll dig down most of the way with a post digger, then hammer the posts in the last few cm so they're stable enough for the next steps.
- I'll secure each in place with postcrete, leaving the level a few cm below ground so I can surround the posts with grass.

My main questions:
- Do I need to worry about the tubes filling up with water and rusting? The bottom end would be open to the soil, so I'd hope it would drain away, and the top will be pretty much sealed.
- Do I need to attach anything the the tubes to stop them pulling out vertically, or will friction be enough?
- Do I need to drill any drainage holes in the side of the tube at ground level to let water out?
- The tubes are galvanised steel, but I'll be cutting them to length myself. Do I need to coat the cut ends in any way before they go in the ground?"

Anyone use the Ez-level for kitchen cabinets?,8,4,"We used them in our kitchen because our floors are so unlevel (we fixed the uneven dips and peaks, but then whole floor slopes to the front of the house). They actually made installation a lot smoother than using all the shims at the hardware store. However, now the cabinets on the low point of the floor are about an inch and a half off the floor. The toe kick will cover it, but is the Ez-level going to hold? Should we shim under the cabinets just for added security? It says they are rated for 700lbs, so they shouldn't move when the countertops are installed, but I guess I am just paranoid. Any help would be greatly appreciated. And look forward to a post in the near future about our full kitchen remodel... That has been going on since November 2018...

"Boarding up doors and windows with planks of 2 x 6 pressure treated lumber. Will this resist burglar kicks? It's only 1.5"" inches thick actual size. Sanity check before I waste my money and do something stupid.",2,10,"I'm a total amateur and don't have many tools or an actual workshop, just posting here because you guys might know the answer. 

Planning on boarding up some doors/windows on a property to prevent more burglaries (seems extreme but that's what I need to do without going into specifics). 

**I have a gap that's 31"" wide. There is 2 and 1/4 inch wide wood ""frame"" on either side. (Kind of thin frame)** (and it goes deep, so i could use long screws if i need to). 

**If I board it up using 2"" x 6"" (and ~35"" long) pressure treated lumber would it resist strong kicks? (it's nominally 2"" but in reality 1.5"" thick).** On each side I'd be nailing and screwing it in with non removable screws to that 2 1/4"" frame. 

This is the wood I plan to use: https://www.homedepot.com/p/WeatherShield-2-in-x-6-in-x-8-ft-1-Ground-Contact-Pressure-Treated-Lumber-253905/206966039

This is a diagram which explains it a lot better. https://i.imgur.com/du831ja.png

I plan on painting over all the edges to make it a little harder to grab with a crowbar.

* Question: would the above plan resist being kicked in? It's 1.5"" thick of solid wood, only supported at the ends. I mean strong kicks, the type they use to kick open doors. I've seen those videos where karate guys break wood with their hands, so I'm starting to doubt whether this would be strong enough to resist hard kicks.

* Question 2: If I did the same basic design, but instead of using 2 x 6 wood, I used plywood (either 23/32"" sheathing plywood or 1/2"" ground contact plywood), would it be equally strong? more strong? less strong? 

* Question 3: What if I combined the wood and the plywood? Would it then resist kicking? I would nail the plywood to the wood and sloppily glue the plywood to the wood (I don't have clamps so the glue may not be strong).

* Question 4. What about just plywood like question 2, but 2 stacks glued together (I don't have clamps, so the glue job wouldn't be high quality, I'd probably just put random things over it like books and whatever... I don't have a lot of heavy stuff).

Thanks guys"

Piano as shelve - keeping the keys,8,2,"Dear subreddit,

in the family we had an old piano which could not be tuned any more and after seeing https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/cgrmki/a_repurposed_piano/ I wanted to give it a try as well.

Now I noticed that when the keys are vertical (which they will be on the wall), there's no more gravitation pushing the hammers onto the keys. That means the keys go in their downwards position but since the hammers are not pushing against that, the keys remain there, as if pushed down permanently.

https://i.imgur.com/440rJqQ.jpg

I am now looking for ideas how to keep them in the initial position. First I thought to lock them down with screws. Thats easy but I wont be able to push them any more, so I am trying to find something which will push them back.

This is how it looks below they keys:

I have two ideas so far which have both their downside: 
&nbsp;

1. put some kind of foamy/spongy marterial below, so I can push the keys down and they go up again. It's easy/cheap, but I bet that the feeling would not be even close to pushing the keys on a functioning piano and also fear that the foam might not endure long time.

2. Spings! but it will be hard to find fitting ones and I am not 100% sure how to twirl them around the metal peg:

Generally the research Ive done so far suggested using a flathead screw driver to pull from behind the head of the screw or using pliers, but because this is recessed by about 1/2 I cant do that.  Ive also tried holding it upside down while I screw (hoping gravity will help) and used strong magnet, with no success.

Any advice?"

Arc Welder in place of Variac & Transformer,8,26,"I'd like to substitute an arc welder in place of a variac + transformer that some of my projects call for. If I operate within the rated duty cycle, will I run into any other issues?

My reasoning is that I dont want to be building transformers and pairing them with a variac without really knowing what I'm doing (I'm an engineer but not of the electrical persuasion). An arc welder might offer numerous safety features in a complete package that is (hopefully) much safer to interact with (relatively). I'll also have some hard numbers to use as safe limits of operation.

The projects I have in mind are generally heating elements up through high current. I'd probably get something that cant output more than 24v since I'm working with effectively unlimited amps."

Do I need to add a stud?,8,12,"There's a finished room in our basement. I want to mount a 24"" TV to the wall using a mount with a ""somewhat articulated"" short (about 6"") arm... the important thing is it's not the kind of mount that keeps the TV ""snug up"" against the wall.  

For unimportant reasons, I need to install the mount smack dab between 2 studs. Well, damn. Luckily, that wall is open to the basement on the other side, so I can easily do <whatever>. Do I need to install a complete stud (floor to ceiling) in that cavity between the 2 existing studs? Is there something else I can (safely) do to allow me to put the mount between the 2 studs? I originally considered running a cross piece between the 2 studs, but that didn't seem safe (not to mention I think the part of the mount that contacts the wall is around 6"" long (vertically), so I'd have to use multiple ""stacked"" cross pieces.

Back again for advice - checklist of things that needs to be done,5,7,"I'm so disappointed. I thought I got a great bargain but it turns out I just didn't know what to look for. 

Please chime in on anything you have any experience on. I appreciate all opinions and thoughts. 

1. Asbestos ducts in the attic; one duct is crushed or stepped on and a potential health hazard. I'm hiring an asbestos removal company to remove the ducts, and then hiring someone to install it. One ducting company offered to do everything cheap, but when he showed up and I asked him about the procedure and it seemed very shady. No negative air pressure setup and he tried to say asbestos isn't dangerous. I kicked him to the curb right away. 
2. Attic insulation is the loose type and most likely has asbestos attached to it since everyone the warranty company sent out to fix that ONE duct needed to turn on the AC.
3. Furnace might be leaking gas. Still need to make appointment with gas company to come check. 
4. Pinhole leak behind shower. This is a funny story. When I first moved in, I remember thinking that my neighbors water their lawns a bit too much; I'd hear the sprinklers going off at all hours of the day. One late night I took a shower and heard the sprinklers on. After my shower, it was still on. In the middle fo the night when I had to use the restroom, it was STILL on. That's when I panicked and checked outside. Nope. No sprinklers. Just a bit of wetness on the other side of my wall where the stucco meets the concrete. All last week, I've been dealing with the insurance company and warranty company. 
5. Miscellaneous landscaping issues but I'll deal with that later. 

**Now, this is what I'm currently working on and need input/ideas/thoughts from all you wonderful DIY-ers.** 

1. Asbestos ducts - I'm hiring a company to do both removal and installation of ducting. They'll contract out to a licensed asbestos removal company and then come in a few days later to install. 
2. IN BETWEEN DUCT REMOVAL AND INSTALLATION, I'm renting an insulation vacuum and redoing the insulation. I plan on getting the goggles and respirator; just checked that the respirator I have is not meant for asbestos. Will need some suggestions. 
3. I've semi-decided on stone vinyl planks with 5.5mm and 0.5mm top layer (20 mil or something like that). This would be for everywhere EXCEPT bathrooms and MAYBE kitchen. 

I've started drinking so I apologize and thank you beforehand."

Redoing plumbing- pipes vibrating when taps turned on,2,7,"So just had some plumbing redone for a sink and was everything was fine until recently. Whenever i turn any of the cold water taps in the house on slightly (o get a small dribble of water comes out) one of the pipes vibrates very loudly.

Ive narrowed it down to the pipe causing it and it doesnt appear to be loose as its not connected to any walls.

The vibrating noise stops when I open the tap more.

The guides online doesnt say anything about vibration only when you turn the taps on slightly and most say things like a water hammer which I dont think it is or problems when you turn the water on too quickly.

Attic Insulation DIY Questions!,7,10,"Hello!

I'm about to embark on my first DIY project of insulating my attic. I received some mixed opinions on quite a few things, so i thought i would consult the experts of reddit to give the final say. I've attached some photos, and here are my questions:

\- I've got recessed lighting throughout the attic (about 8 unites with 1000 sq feet). The lights seem to be IC rated when i look up the units online, but they don't say anything about that on the actual unites when I examine them in the attic. It's not super easy to get up close to them ( very small ceilings). I guess i'm just paranoid. My question is: Should i still try to air seal these with a cover? Or will i be okay?

\- If i choose not to seal the recessed lights, how should i go about marking where they are since i'll have about 12 inches of insulation and they'll be covered. Also, how would i go about marking other things like fans or electrical boxes? Is that something that is normally done?

\-There's a bunch cables scattered throughout as well as electrical boxes.

\- Can the bathroom fan unit be covered with cellulose insulation as well? I assume there's no fire hazard there.

Thank you all!!"

Oven making a ringing noise,2,5,"Hi I bought a flat last year that had in built appliances. The first time I used the oven I noticed it made a ringing noise for a few moments when turned off. Over time it's gotten worse and now rings whenever it's turned on and for a long time after being turned off. I've googled it and found results about loose screws but I've tightened all the screws I can see and it's still doing it! Any advice?

Looking for some advice about a Yale lock.,5,5,"Looking for a quick bit of advice about a lock.

Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

I know its going to be difficult to diagnose the problem without actually seeing it - but Im just looking for a bit of advice. I have a Yale lock on my front door - about 4-5 years old and I noticed recently the handle (on the inside of the house) is a little loose. Nothing major - maybe 3/4mm give all around. I can wiggle it a bit - maybe I only just noticed but it seemed quite tight before. It doesnt feel not secure - but it feels a little loose. Ive looked up the problem, but all the advice is a little vague.

Secondly, on the outside - where I put the key in there is maybe another 3/4mm of turn before I feel any resistance to indicate the mechanism is kicking into action. I dont notice this before - but maybe I just wasnt paying attention. 

Couple of questions - is this a worry? Should I call someone out to take a look at the lock? Im going away next month and someone is coming over every day with a key and dont want it to break on them.

Secondly - is this something I can fix myself? Im fairly DIY savvy I think. Is this just a case of removing the lock and tightening some screws? 

Any advice would be great - but I would totally understand if the only advice is get a professional to take a look. 

Thanks."

Fixing a table saw rip fence,6,8,"Hey all. I borrowed my grandpa's table saw and his aluminum rip fence has been abused on both sides by the blade. When making cuts the wood gets caught in the grooves and is hard to push through.
Nobody really uses the saw regularly so instead of replacing the fence I was thinking of gluing some wood or plastic to the fence on both sides to make it easier to use. Any recommendations on materials that will not get damaged from the wood but still let it glide smoothly?"

Advice on laying a floor over concrete,17,29,"A little over a year ago I started looking into converting our garage into a workshop. The walls are single breeze blocks and the floor was unsealed concrete, but unfortunately after sealing the floor life got in the way and the project was shelved.  
Fast forward to now and I'm eager to get the job done, especially before the cold / damp really kicks in this year.  
I work as a cabinet maker so have a fair understanding of tools / wood, but apart from putting up a small stud wall a few years back I've never done any constructional work.  
I figured I'd start on the floor as it's likely the easiest part, then move onto the walls from there.

My goal is pretty much to copy what this guy has done [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR8SqpguwzM) - 2x4's laid across the floor, fill the gaps with some insulation, slap a vapour barrier down over the top and cover the whole thing with 18mm sheets, leaving ~10mm around each edge.

My main questions here are:  
1. How should I secure the shims / boards to the floor? He says in the comments something about spaghetti screws, but I can't seem to find that outside of Australia.  
2. He puts plastic under the shims which makes sense, but then if you screw through that won't the screw break the seal?  
3. He also fills the gaps between the shims with what seems like [SikaFlex](https://www.uksealants.co.uk/sikaflex-ebt-adhesive-sealant-filler.html), although I'm guessing at which type exactly. I'm going to have lathes / bandsaws running on parts of the floor so I'm thinking it'd definitely needed in some places, but doing the whole floor with it would cost a fortune. Any other suggestions?  
4. Anything else I've missed, or any other advice greatly appreciated!"

Need help/advice on retaining wall project.,7,7,"Our home is build on about 5-6 feel hill taller than our neighbors behind us. When I bought my house, the property behind us had tall trees and foliage to sock in our yard with shade, green, and just peace. Recently the neighbor cut down all the trees and wants to build another house behind us. This really screwed us, because my yard sharply drops off about 1-2 foot from our actual property line in some areas, and the top of our fence is only about 4 ft from the yard level where the yard is.

Ive gotten a few quotes and having a professional do a retaining wall to raise our property so we can actually put a normal size fence up is too expensive. I am going to have to do this myself, terrifying but also after watching YouTube I feel like I could do it. I just have a few specific questions that I was wondering if anyone can help with.

There are already stones that are relatively flat that come up about 1-2 ft from the previous owners of the house that is on our property line. The current fence is 1-2 ft in front of that, so the goal would be to build that wall up, fill it with dirt and put a new fence where we get all our land and fence height. All the videos Ive seen talk about digging your base and setting gravel/blocks at the bottom about ~9 under ground level. My neighbor said that he thought they did that with these stones, but I have no real way of checking.

1) how can someone check previous stones to see if its a good base to build a wall on top of? I was just gonna dig in front of it and see if it laid properly.

2) if its a good base, would it be better to build the wall on top of that (would definitely be easier) or is it always best practice to rip up old stone and start fresh?

3) if I have to start fresh, how on earth am I supposed to get the original stones out? Jackhammer?

4) if I use the original base, what can I do to make my first level of stone secure and level? I was thinking of mortaring the first blocks on the stone and putting drain pipes in.

Any help would be appreciated.

Edit: some guys at church were saying that since my stone base is pretty stable (I think), I can just mortar the first level of blocks to the stone and make sure that the first row is level. Id make sure to put drain tubes throughout and am planning on putting a drain pipe at the base of 6 of gravel behind the wall. Drainage shouldnt be a problem. Thoughts from handy men and women who know this stuff more than me?"
Dryer installation help,4,16,"Im having trouble installing the dryer vent hose thing to the duct in the wall. The hose is a standard 4 inch and the duct in the wall is not completely circular, with no lip around it to secure the vent hose. I bought a four inch wall connector hoping it would help, but its not flexible enough to fit inside the duct. 

I didnt have any issues at my old apartment, as it was a brand new complex. The one Im in now is a bit older and Im not sure if its just worn from so many tenants or if it was just installed incorrectly. Either way, its extremely frustrating. 

How can I make the vent hose connect to the wall safely? I put in a maintenance request but they havent been helpful. 

Does anyone have any advise on what kind of products are needed to make it work? Id like to ideally keep my original vent hose thing as its brand new and really good quality. Any info helps.

"looking for cement board VS membrane advice for tiling over wood subfloor, on top of my fired contractors screwed up attempt",20,38,"good morning,

i have an old ass house. built in 1932. and i'm wanting to tile the floor of what will become the mud room.

hired a guy who seemed legit, and claimed plenty of experience w/tiling. i have since learned otherwise and let him go.

unfortunately, i was dumb enough that it took him fucking up half the tile job for me to figure things out.

so! dear DIYers of reddit, now i've got some questions.

this is all happening on a wood floor, on wood joists : diagonal lumber sub floor, with plywood over the top.

the real issue is that the floor had/has linoleum over the plywood. about a 2/3s of which was removed when asbestos mastic was discovered. the whole floor was then covered in an encapsulate and then half-assed leveled by my former contractor.

the floor is lumpy and saggy, as we all get to be when we're almost 100 years old.

squeaks like hell when you walk around, so there's obvious movement happening.

my plan is to rip out the shitty tile, scrape the floor down a bit, *correctly* pour on leveler and then do the tile.

i'm fine with a membrane solution like Ditra, or a traditional durock product.

that being said, the 1/8"" thickness of Ditra, and the ease of installation make it seem like a better choice, even at the higher price. but i'm concerned about whether it will be the strongest option considering the age and condition of the floor in general.

durock gets screwed into the subfloor, so i think it may be better able to resist the flexing that i'm sure will still be present even after the leveler is applied.

any advice?

thanks!

Can anyone suggest a DIY fix for my wheelchair?,693,136,"Recently I heard a pop when I transferred over into my wheelchair.  When I took my seat cushion off my chair, I saw the following:

https://i.imgur.com/nesyOdV.png

https://i.imgur.com/Vze14xv.png

The pop I heard was the screw in the far left hole there snapping, apparently the first two screws on the right had already previously snapped at some point and I never noticed; it could have happened days ago, weeks ago, or even months ago for all I know... The little bars with the holes in them are what hold the canvas of my seat to the frame the wheelchair... As you can see, without those front two screws, one of the bars has been bent inward from my continuing the use the seat without knowing this had happened.

The screws snapped down inside of their screw holes.  I don't own any power tools, so I can't drill the screws out or anything like that... I am also quite poor, so I can't afford to pay someone else to do it.  The chair is about half a decade out of warranty as well, so I can't afford to have it repaired.  And I definitely can't afford to get a new wheelchair.

Can anyone suggest something that isn't prohibitively expensive I could do to keep using my wheelchair?

How realistic is this DIY Kitchen Island with no experience whatsoever?,3,8,"https://www.housebythebaydesign.com/build-a-diy-kitchen-island/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=pinterest&utm_campaign=tailwind_tribes&utm_content=tribes&utm_term=608473214_22972004_263925

My girlfriend and I are looking for an island to put in the middle of this kitchen: https://imgur.com/a/Gcy0q4u. We plan on doing the tiles and getting new stainless steel appliances. Still undecided on those. 

1. This is a temporary home for a few years until we can buy our forever home. We plan to rent the place out after we move, so we are looking for affordable, but attractive options (but mostly affordable).

2. For the island, wood butcher blocks seem to be the most affordable option. We are leaning towards a navy blue finishing for the island with a wood countertop. 

3. How hard is this if my girlfriend and I have absolutely zero experience in all of this? Also, how hard is it to install a built-in microwave into the island?

4. Any other tips and recommendations are very much appreciated."

I was thinking I could make these 12 ft long & slip them on a 6ft or 8ft folding table, with smaller blocks of 1x3 underneath to frame the smaller table, so the top wouldn't slide around. 

Am I insane to think this would work? Would the 3ft overhang on the end cause the tabletop to tip if someone leaned on it? If I made them from inexpensive pine, would I have to worry about warping in such a long project? Are there questions I'm not even asking that I should be?

Edit: the folding tables would be rented, so I wouldn't have the opportunity to permenantly attach it. I was thinking I could attach a piece of wood to the kind of cleats underneath to swivel under the edges of the folding table to hold it in place."

Not sure if water is off?,1,14,"Upstairs I have a place that should be a shower, but currently the pipes are just capped off. I want to install a shower valve there, so I would need to cut the caps off and then solder in the valve.

Before doing that, I figure I need to turn off the water, so I went downstairs and found what I assume is the valve in my boiler room. I closed it, then waited a while, then to check, I turned on my faucet in the kitchen.

Water is still coming out of the faucet, albeit significantly reduced rate. Not quote a trickle, but close. However, I cant turn the value anymore than it's already turned, so I cant close it any more.

I'm worried that if I try to cut the caps off those pipes upstairs, a little water will still be flowing in them, and then I'll be stuck with water spilling into my walls, since I wont be able to solder anything with water coming out of the pipe.

What should I do here?"

How do I get the bottom of my deck stairs (stringers) out of standing water?,2,9,"I've got a back deck with wooden stairs coming down onto the driveway. The whole area is asphalt (AFAIK). The problem is, the bottom of the stringers are sitting in a little valley where water collects in the rainy winters. The stringers were so rotted the the entire bottom step broke off. So I'm about to put in new stringers but I haven't done a lot of this type of work. What are my options to keep the stringers (and adjoining posts) high and dry? 

I could try to re-grade that area but I'm not sure how that would go. Just forward of the little gulley the stringers are sitting in, the ground levels off so there's nowhere obvious for the water to be directed. 

Could the stringers sit on top of a masonry brick product of some sort that's lifts them a few inches? Would I just trim the bottom of the stringers by the height of the masonry? Alternatively, could I mix up some cement and fill in the valley?

Custom shower pan issues!,1,3,"Alright, so we need a custom size shower pan and have the intention of pouring a custom one with mortar. I know I need a ratio of 5 part sand to 1 part concrete, but also understanding the commercial Quikrete sand/concrete 60lb bag is a 3:1.

The Main Issue:
Pan is going on a concrete floor in a basement. We had the pipes put into the floor and everything is already sealed and concrete has been poured over the top BUT it was done wrong and our show drain is now level with the basement floor, not elevated to allow space for the first pour.

Is it best to:
A) do the first pour and narrow it down feather thin to the drain, use additional specified epoxies and hardeners from the manufacturer,  and continue on with the membrane and second pour.

B) do the first pour, but leave a few inches around the drain itself to avoid the feather thin mortar. Fill said area with caulk/epoxy under the shower membrane.

I've looked at shower systems too. But same issue. I cant find any special part to partially extend the PVC drain up and allow the needed clearance.

Need to know what would be best to have under all those layers so I dont have a shift underneath that ruptures my shower membrane or causes total collapse on my tile floors once finished."

Is this a valid concern, and if so how do I get around it? Will I need to build a box roller and attach the casters to it, and then attach the cabinet to it?

Need help making modifications to a temporary window in my apartment (details inside!),0,7,"Long story short, my window broke several months ago due to construction my Landlord has been doing.

Instead of owning up to it and fixing it, he made everything complicated by making up his own version of events and now we're going through a lot of court related stuff to try and get someone to order him to fix it.

I've prefaced by typing that out so you can understand that the window was broken. The inner pane was broken and the outer pane was cracked. All kinds of noise was leaking through the cracked/broken window, but it wasn't too bad. You couldn't hear much from outside when there was noise on the inside.

This week, my Landlord finally got someone to come out and take a look. They removed the window completely ""while waiting on a new window to come in"", and said it would be several weeks until they could come and install.

To hold me off in the meantime, the guy put a temporary window (just a board of plastic it seems) and jammed it in there and held it in place using foam tubes.

The problem is this board of plastic is 10x worse than the cracked window. You might as well have no board at all. The  noise just jumps out from the inside.

I need some tips if possible to insulate or jam the space between the plastic board (window) and the frame. There is a space there about 1-1.5 inch thick.

Picture: https://i.imgur.com/aAZ7sE6.jpg

I've attached a picture to help you see the window. I've taped around the sides just in case there were any gaps leaking sound to the outside. It helped a tiny bit, but tape isn't going to block out anything, as we all know.

I don't mind completely blocking or putting something up that would prevent me from using the window itself. I can use the one right next to it, which is intact.

So guys, are there any cheap options to help me retain some privacy using this temporary window? I've thought about going out and buying acoustic panels/foam, but I have no idea how good those things are and people keep complaining.

Thanks for any help or tips in advance!"

"Help with my rolling gaming station, and temperatures.",6,26,"So Ive been sitting on this idea for a year or two now, and now that my son is getting a little older and much more interested in video games (only a *little* help from me), Id like to bring this idea to fruition. 

So I bought this [rolling cabinet](https://imgur.com/a/zgw00iK)with a little shelf space in it, drilled out some holes in the back for cables to come through to the top for monitor and whatnot, and I put my Xbox inside the cabinet (you can laugh) thinking nothing was wrong. Hour or two later it over heated, who wouldve thought.... Were tight on space in the house, so wherever me or my son wants to log some time on the consoles, I roll the cart to and from and plug the power strip in and were good to go. 

Anyway, the cabinet itself is a little too tall to bring the monitor to eye level, which isnt the biggest deal, and not my main concern. (Im hoping I can mount the monitor on some type of arm to bring it down and in front of the cabinet for comfortability, but I have yet to find such an arm/mount that clamps or mounts to a surface AND the monitor/TV.) 

Further, to create less clutter and cables all over the place, Id really like to fashion some way to keep the consoles *inside* the cabinet. Even with the doors open it gets to an uncomfortable temperature.

Ive never done anything like this, but I also dont want to cut holes and mount some PC fans and do all of the wiring if it wont matter in the long run/wont work. 

Curious to see if anyone has done anything like this, or could offer some ideas!! Thanks in advance!

EDIT: Thank you all for the help! Now that the cooling issue is resolved, does anyone have any idea for a monitor arm that swivels, extends and lowers? Sorry if that sounds incorrect, I just dont know the proper term for what it would be. Similar to the wall mounts with a swivel/bend arm for TVs."

How to attach Ledger Board to TOP of CMU?,2,3,"Hi DIY - I am in the process of finalizing my plans for the construction of my workshop. I have looked at lots of examples and trying to save some money where I can etc. 

I want to use CMUs for the floating foundation: Like they did [HERE](http://www.seans.com/Photos/Shed03/04-FoundatonNearlyComplete.jpg).  I believe this will be perfect for my shed and will handle everything I want to do. HOWEVER (instead of BUT)... I can't figure out how they attach the ledger boards to the CMUs [HERE](http://www.seans.com/Photos/Shed03/06-FloorFramingComplete.jpg). My layout is just a bit different - but still can't figure out how they attached it and made it solid. 

Can anyone tell me the best way to do it?

Of note, I want the CMUs all the way around to deter pests etc + it should be very solid once the shed is on top of it. 

I intend to use mobile home anchors over the joists to secure it to the ground - but I am leary of this being enough to secure the entire thing to the CMUs. 

Looking for awesome suggestions. :)  (I did some Google-Fu for answers, however, most sheds are just put on a few blocks or on a slab (way too costly for a 20x20 shed. :)

Installing a roof anchor for holiday decorations?,1,4,"Hi guys, figure this is the right place to come. 

We are big holiday decorators and want to do some roof decorations this year on our shingled roof. Very light stuff, less than 3lb plastic skeletons & such. I did some research and found a lot of info on roof anchors & ended up buying a pair of [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004A7XUQU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 

Here's my question: all of the installation videos I can find online are for roof anchors being installed on the roof peak, not on the side, which is where I need ours installed. I found tons of pics of ones installed on the side, but no instructionals. I went up there today and, it looks like all I need to do is pry up a shingle carefully, slide the anchor underneath, nail it in, seal it up, and then affix the shingle back down over it. Is this correct?

Also, [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Black-Leak-Stopper-Rubberized-Roof-Patch/23331124) is the sealant I was recommended by the guy at Lowes. Is this all I need to use? Sorry for the less-than-professional question, but any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

Pergola wall support issue,4,6,"I'm currently underway building a pergola against our home, we're based in Germany and the house was built 3 years ago to the highest insulation standard possible (KW55). This build standard means a massive amout of insulation and unfortunately a massive unforseen block of insulation above the standard German window roll shutter housing.

The wall where i need to glue in bolts for the pergola support is for the most part above 2 doors, this presents the issue that all the outer bolts will go into the following wall materials (in this order):

1. 3cm outer render
2. 7cm hard insulation
3. 4cm of the door lintel, hard concrete

Of 13 support bolts only the center 5 go into solid wall, the rest are equally over the 2 doors. Here's a picture of one side, this is a mirror of the other door.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/fvv1q3w050p31.png

My issue is that all the outer bolts will have to go into the formentioned insulation and lintel, I'm concerned that if i go ahead with attaching the support i'll eventually end up with a very broken wall.  


* I can't move the pergola support upwards
* i can't lengthen the support

Does anyone have any idea how i might stabalise this? Below is a stock photo of the Pergola i'm DIY'ing:

I am looking to fix it up and have researched some options. 

I was considering a few options:
1. Take out the tile and replace it with an acrylic pan. From what I understand, the pan has a lip that goes under the wall tile. This would require me tearing tiles off the walls.

2. Clean the tiles and reseal them. I would still have to stand on the tiles.

I prefer option one but, don't want to rip out the walls. 

Is there a way either put a pan on top of the existing floor? 
I imagine it would impossible to stop water going between the existing floor and the pan which would cause problems. 

Or is there another possible solution that I am missing?

Bathroom Remodeling Questions [Concrete/Mortar Design],1,10,"Questions:  What is the best and lowest cost method of obtaining a mortar or concrete surface on my walls/ceiling in my bathroom, and how do I best go about colorizing it to look similar [to this](http://modernmasterscafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2-Metallic-Plaster-Wall-Finish-for-Bedroom.jpg)?

Im remodeling our bathroom, and Im wanting our walls/ceiling to be covered with either a type of mortar/cement for aesthetics (such as brush strokes and texture design).  The questions are about how to do this properly, with proper moisture protection, and how to best go about colorizing the surface of mortar or concrete (stain vs dye, etc.).  Currently, were gutting it out to the studs.  

Regarding the construction process, I think we need to attach plywood to all surfaces, seal the plywood, place mortar for cement boards, place cement boards, place concrete/mortar, allow cure time, stain, seal.  With this all being a costly process, is there an easier or cheaper way to obtain the structural support of the material while sticking with either concrete or mortar?  Im avoiding plaster since it chips too easily.

Regarding the colorizing, I understand the options to mostly be stain or dye.  I only find instructions about it for concrete, but would the same processes also work for mortar?  While dye appears the easiest, Im more wanting the aesthetics of stain.  Everything seems relatively easy for stain up until where I consider how to neutralize the acid.  All instructions state to wash it off, which is more easily said than done when working indoors with plywood flooring.  I saw [this product](https://youtu.be/1gWNp_B-dhw) that says there is no acid, which then Im not sure how its actually staining the concrete.  They go directly from staining to sealing.  Can anyone make sense of that?"

Tricky landscaping issue with townhouse,3,2,"Hello, 
I have a conundrum of what I should do landscaping-wise on a tricky spot in front of my house. I live in a row of townhouses built in 1986. The developers decided to build on a hill and step the foundations down between every other unit or so. Which puts my foundation a little of a foot above my neighbor's.

I'm redoing the front landscaping and discovered that previous owners were very careless.

They built a pseudo retaining wall up against the neighbors wall extending well above their foundation making a nice dark moist area ideal for termites - the wood I pulled out was riddled with termite damage and from the images above you can see the damage to the neighbor's trim and I imagine it continues into her house.

My question is, how should I go about landscaping in this area? I imagine I need an honest retaining wall of some sort but am unsure how to proceed because of the neighbor's property."

Walking off a garage door but keeping it operable,0,9,"Okay so Ive tried my best at google and unfortunately all my buzz words just show me how to take off the garage door. 

Now I have a 30x18  attached/detached garage. I live in an HOA and a quad (4 houses all sharing walls at some point)  I do not plan on being in this house for much longer, lets say 3 years.

Im looking to turn the larger part of my garage into a hangout area for DnD and what not. The current walls are open with no insulation. I also cannot have a shed on my property so I still need storage space for lawn equipment. 

Down to the question at hand. I wish to make the part of my garage that has my outside water sprocket and garage door walled off from the rest of the garage.  Im not very handy and will need to be able to disassemble this wall when it comes time to sell. 

My question is what is the easiest material to wall off a certain section of my garage while keeping the garage door operation and having the wall sturdy enough but also able to be taken down in a pinch if need be. Id prefer to use some type of insulation to keep the area climate cool and certainly want to keep bugs out of the area as well (the garage as a whole if thats possible lol)

I hope this doesnt break the rules like I said Ive tried searching elsewhere but everything just wants me to remove the garage door which I cant. 

TLDR; I need to wall off the inside section of my garage door and keep it operational and be able to take the wall down easily when it comes time to sell."

Help building a collapsible sleeping platform for the back of my car,1,8,"Hey there, I couldn't find any project that matched what I have in mind on Google, so I thought I'd drop my idea here to see what you guys made of it.

Basically, I want a sleeping platform -- essentially just a low table -- to cover the back of my car, with a board resting on that and the back of the folded down seats together forming a place to put a mattress. Ideally I would build it in two parts, one for each side of the car, so I can choose whether I want to use the entire back of the car or whether I want it for storage. The final criterion that I want is that it should be collapsible and able to be stored compactly, as well as assembled and disassembled quickly.

&#x200B;

What I was thinking was build it as two tables, one for each side of the car. The tables would be made of a plywood (or similar) sheet, with PVC pipe table caps screwed into the underside. I would then cut PVC pipe to the right length, and that would slot into the table caps to make the legs. If PVC isn't going to be robust enough, I could look at using steel pipe and flanges...

Has anyone made or know of this kind of fastener? (Looks like plastic or hot glue to me..IDK),5,6,"[https://imgur.com/a/ffOTRpE](https://imgur.com/a/ffOTRpE)

I want to secure a plastic badge to a plastic hole, like the image shown. Does anyone know what the fastener is made of and how the fastener is produced and secured on the plastic badge?

**Material:**

At first, I thought the fastener was made of hot glue, but I don't think a hot glue gun can make this kind of shape consistently if used manually.

I tried to look up the shape of the fastener. On Amazon, among other products, U-brackets, pipe straps and conduit strap (clamps) resembles the shape.

I'm starting to think it could be plastic too.

&#x200B;

**Method of Production:**

I have no idea yet.

&#x200B;

**How did the fastener get secured to the badge?**

The fastener is stuck to the badge. I suspected the fastener was produced separately and that the fastener's bottom ends got heated and pressed against the badge and once cooled, they bonded.

I tried to melt off the fastener with a heated steel rod, but I melted some of the plastic off the badge which ruined the badge and made plastic smoke residue.

The fastener was secured so neatly to the badge. If they were heat bonded like I guessed, I would think the heat source had to heat the fastener just enough to stick but not enough to melt the plastic badge once the heated fastener was pressed against it manually.

&#x200B;

I could use some help because I'm stuck. Can someone redirect me if this isn't the place to ask?  Thanks for any help in advance!

Can any of this deck be salvaged?,6,23,"So my house had a deck when we moved in. It was obviously split into two parts: the original part built by the contractor, and a cheap addition added by one of the previous owners. The addition put in by the previous owners is a death trap and is coming down regardless of what happens to the rest of it. What I don't know is if any of the original deck joists or posts can be salvaged or not. The joists all look fine, but the posts have splits of varying severity running along the grain. My hope was that I could just replace the rails and the decking boards, but I doubt that's the right thing to do. 

Here's a link to photos of the deck: [https://imgur.com/a/wUQI1m2](https://imgur.com/a/wUQI1m2)

I have three primary questions:

1. Can any of this deck be saved? 
2. Assuming I have to tear it all down, do I even rip off the ledger board and replace that? 
3. If I opt to build a smaller deck (likely), it will not run the entire length of the existing ledger board. How do I handle that? Do I need to add siding back to cover where the board used to be or is there another way to handle it?"

He says he wants to build some shelving units and a ""wardrobe"" for the apartment. Along with some small outdoor benches for his community garden he is apart of. We have had a lot of rain over the past several weeks and I'm wondering how safe they are for indoor use. I really don't want to risk any potential bug transfer and also the history of the pallets are unknown so I don't know what their past use has been. I don't think outdoor benches would be an issue but anything indoor seems too risky."

How should I mount my legs to the table top?",4,5,"Hey all, I'm fairly new to this kind of DIY project, but I'm building an L shaped desk that is 10 feet long one way, 7 feet the other, and 2 feet wide. The 10 feet will mostly for me and my wife's computers and screens for gaming, and the other 7 feet will have a mounted piano keyboard underneath that slides in and out for easy use and storage. 

I've included a picture of my work and a few sketches of my design so far here:  https://imgur.com/a/FSgO2GQ

I'm doing this project in 2 pieces, so I can fit them in the room. A 7x2' desk top, and an 8x2' desk top. I've finished cutting and staining the 7x2' piece and want to attach legs and the hardware for the sliding drawer. 

I looked up many different ways to attach the legs (28"" 2x4 whitewood) but I'm not sure the best way to go about it. I was thinking I could just drill down from the top of the desk into the legs, to hold them in place, but I think that would end up looking bad. I've also stained the top and want to do a coat or two of polyurethane, and if I do that it will either cover up the screws, or i go through the polyurethane afterwards. 

I've also seen methods of pocket screws (which I haven't ever tried) and wood glue (but I may have to disassemble this later) so I'm not sure those work. 

For the legs, would i need to make braces for it? (like the triangle kind I could make from 2x4s)

Overall I think my concept is pretty decent, but I'm kinda stuck when it comes to actually attaching the tabletop to the legs. Any help would be greatly appreciated!"

Help making this utility sink usable,17,18,"It's obvious this is bigger than me. Plug back in. Thanks everybody!

~~In my basement laundry room, we have a utility sink that was set up with only cold water, and a drain that just basically let the water flow into a rusted floor drain.~~

~~Since then I've cobbled together a solution for hot water, and put some bilge tubing in to get it to drain better, but there's leakage at multiple spots. Unfortunately, I don't know the terms for the place where I'm draining the water, so google-fu is not helping me too much.~~

~~Here's a gallery of pictures to see what I'm talking about.~~ [~~http://imgur.com/gallery/WaIvgoc~~](http://imgur.com/gallery/WaIvgoc)

~~A couple problems: 1.) The sink is 4-5 feet from where it eventually drains into the main pipe. 2.) The tubing it drains into kind of needs to be flexible so that it can get around a refrigerator we are putting next to it, and squeeze behind the washing machine (seen in the pictures) 3.) There's leakage at both ends because (surprise surprise!) shoving bilge tubing into the hole doesn't magically make a water tight seal. 4.) Do I need to find a way to elevate the drain tubing so it feeds downward into it's final destination? If so I'm in trouble because the bottom of the sink is fairly low and quite deep and the drain is probably 4-6 inches up. Not a lot of wiggle room. 5.) Finally I have no idea what that yellow plug in the last picture is called and I feel like knowing that alone would send me on a wonderful internet journey of answering questions.~~

~~The idea is to be able to use the sink as part of a make-shift kitchenette. It won't be cute, but hopefully you'll be able to wash dishes in it.~~

~~Thanks for reading! Let me know if you have any ideas or know what that blasted plug is called!~~"

Can you please validate the current electrical connections for no issues?,0,41,"Picture says 1000 words:
http://imgur.com/gallery/eFWUz9m

The electrician has done the wiring for the basement and electrical inspection is scheduled for Friday. While doing the wiring he installed two dedicated 20amp circuits (yellow wire) in my under the stairs AV rack for my home theater. The intent is for my subwoofer and projector I needed dedicated circuits. Right next to this, he installed another dummy outlet with a Romex run (again yellow wire) running from the projector outlet in the ceiling to here. The intent is so that a power inlet can be used at the av rack such as this from Amazon MIDLITE 4642-W Single Gang Dcor Recessed Power Inlet https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002XDQAA6/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_i_S7UIDb8X22R9Q.
Once the above is installed the inlet will draw power from the 20amp outlet so that the projector will draw it's power from a dedicated circuit. I have done a similar run for another outlet but have used 14g white wire. My questions are as follows:

1. Given the above inlet capacity on Amazon which is 15amp power inlet, can the wire that runs behind it as well as what powers it be the yellow wire?

2. For the outlet and inlet combination i installed is it ok to use white wire or should I use yellow wire?"

The previous owners redid the basement and turned it into a nice master bedroom. The only problem they didn't install the bamboo wood floors correctly. They installed them so tight to the walls there is no room for them to expand during the humid weather and they buckled and split even with a dehumidifier running nonstop.

I would like to replace the floors and not ever have to worry about them buckling again. Thoughts on what type of material would be best to last ontop of the concrete that is underneath the bamboo? Slate, something that will absorb the moisture. It's roughly 400sqft, we're not rolling in money and will probably do it ourselves so nothing too high end.

Freestanding Patio Roof Advice,0,2,"Hey, longtime lurker here. I just closed on a house that has brick veneer siding. I was thinking of building a freestanding patio roof over an existing concrete patio since Im not comfortable with attaching a ledger to the veneer, even with those fancy BVLZ connectors. 

My question is, can I build the patio roof freestanding and butt the roof up against the house? Or would it shift due to the elements and tear caulking off? If so, whats the closest I can get that patio roof to the house so it gives the appearance that the roof is attached to the house and allow water run off? Im in Georgia and it seldom snows here, like once every four years so I dont figure snow is a huge factor in the construction. 

If this is a terrible idea. I may just lay down concrete away from the house and build the free standing patio roof that way to complete mitigate my problem. Either way works if possible, but the former is much more aesthetically pleasing to my wifes eyes. Thanks in advance!"

was thinking maybe attaching small plywood spacers onto the studs and then regular drywall on top of it and patch/sand down as needed since the thickness varies.

I plan on laying ditra and then tiling the entire first floor.  I have recently discovered that the living room joist span is on the edge of too far for L/360 deflection. All other areas of the house are properly supported underneath with beams and the correct distances. 

Should I be doing sistering on the existing 2x10s?  Or bridging with 2x10 sections between the joists?

The wood is dry and not much creaking or squeaking. Just a bit bouncier than I would like and I want to be sure my tiles dont pop back off after all this work. 

Anyone have experience with or info on standard practices for correcting deflection without installing a beam?  What is the best way to lessen the bouncing?  Thanks"

https://i.redd.it/u6ww63e16mo31.jpg

I used 4 wall hooks and screwed them to the wall as equally as possible to the shape of the PS4 with the hook bodies fitting flush against the PS4 casing almost as if to hold it tight, after inserting the PS4 into the hook bodies the slightly larger end caps then screw on separately and clamp the PS4 in position by grabbing into the guttering that surrounds the PS4 casing.

This allows you to slide the PS4 in and out of the hooks left and right if needed but wont allow the PS4 to be pulled forwards!

The towel hooks are slightly longer than they need to be so the PS4 does sit a little bit loose so i just doubled up some self adhesive felt pads (for chair legs) to pack of the PS4 from the wall which has made it fit nice and snug!

Would planting a hedge row on the upper side of a retaining wall cause it to fail?,2,3,"I have a stone retaining wall that's between about 12"" and 30"" tall. I'd like to plant a hedge row following the wall, with the centre of the hedge trees would be about 28"" from the wall. I'm wondering if the roots of the laurels could cause the stones to collapse over time. As the pictures show there are several large trees which are decades old near the wall and there's no visible damage so I suspect there's not going to be a problem but I'm new to all this. I've uploaded some pictures of the wall here:

Installing a shelf where I can't anchor the back,3,9,"To preface this, I have a very old house (built around 1910)

I am trying to install a shelf in the kitchen and the wall i want to hang it on is concrete or bricks covered in plaster.

It sounds easy right? but i can't seem to drill more than half an inch into the wall.

I have a combination hammer drill and i have used masonry bits and metal bits (I thought i was hitting some rebar in the wall). but all i am doing is chewing up the wall and making the hole wider. I have tried drilling at different points on the wall (vertically and horizontally across) but i keep getting stuck at the same depth. I live in a semi and this is the shared wall so i don't want to get to heavy duty with a stronger hammer drill and go through it.

SO, my plan is to anchor the shelf on the ends. One end has a wood cabinet and the other is the same brick/cement but i seem to be able to drill through it.

The shelf is 6 feet long. My questions are:

1) Is this a terrible idea/have very poor strength and support?

2) Would a hardwood vs. softwood provide better support?

3) Can i still make this a floating shelf? or do I need to make sure there is more support under the shelf as well?

Hated our banister so decided a change was necessary.,2,11,"[https://imgur.com/a/GUQf46v](https://imgur.com/a/GUQf46v)

This started off with my wife complaining that she hated the existing banister because it looked ugly. I decided that rather than spending money on getting a new one I'd try take the project on myself.

I started by stripping the paint off. I used a heat gun for the pieces that I could remove from the fittings and for the posts and then used chemical paint remover on the parts of the staircase I couldn't take off. This left the wood looking really old and stained so I was initially considering just painting it a different colour. I figured I'd sand it down first though to get it a bit smoother.

I sanded it all down with the combined efforts of a random orbital sander and a detail sander. This left the wood looking clean and new. That's when my wife and I decided on trying out the natural wood look but I wanted to do something to protect the wood.

I looked into a variety of finishing products including different oils, lacquers and varnishes and considered different colours too but in the end we wanted it well protected but as close to the natural colour as possible. I settled on an oil based varnish which then meant applying four coats over the entire banister which took a while as I was only able to do it around my work and social schedule.

It's taken a while to get here but it is finally done and now I think I feel brave enough to take on a new project in the house!"

Interior plywood wall install,2,9,"Very much a beginner DIY-er here and I need some advice. I am cladding the interior of my music studio in plywood. It is on ground level in a rather flood-prone area so the idea is that it would be easier and cheaper to remove and replace plywood panels than sheetrock in the very likely even if a flood. Because of that I am not going to use any liquid nails or fancy wood plugs for countersunk screws. 

I am using a cheaper grade 1/2 inch so it won't be tongue and groove. Anyone have ideas on how to make the exposed joints and screws look ok without spending a fortune?

Help with painting the insides of cabinets.,2,4,"Hey r/DIY !

Absolute DIY noob here when it comes to bigger projects, yes bigger than sewing a sweater basically. We recently bought and apartment and it has these old huge cabinets which we want to keep for now. We do have a professional doing the outside cause he said ""no biggie"" when we asked him if he could do that when painting the walls but Im not happy with the insides either.

&#x200B;

I tried to search online as to what paint or even method (spray vs brush) to use but most refer to a different kind of wood it feels and generally the outside (I think this is like sheet wood/compressed wood)! My main issue is that I feel like the wook smells, bad and I want to kind of ""seal"" that with the paint or seal it and then paint it, if thats what you do?  Since its the inside of the closet and it will have clothes in it, I figured it doesnt need to be super pretty.

&#x200B;

I found ways for plywood but since the wood used is already smooth and not gritty I feel like this isnt the right thing? Also if anyone has tips for these magnetic closures, Id appreciate it- they same like they just dont work anymore. Is it just cheaper to replace them after painting everything?

First time renting a place where I'm responsible for utilities; trying to ensure they stay low this winter [Wyoming]. Am I missing anything? Any cheap projects I could undertake to help?,58,88,"So, we've \[surprisingly, for some people\] always rented houses and apartments where utilities were included, so it's never been an issue.  But we just recently had the opportunity to move out into the county on a nice, large piece of land with a decent doublewide mobile home.  Only catch is that for the first time in my 34 years on this planet, I have to be worried about utilities....natural gas, water, and electric.

I've done my research on the topic \[as per Rule 4\], but I just want some input as to whether or not I've missed something...or if someone else has come across something unusual or creative to help.

*Note:  Heat is natural gas, water heater is electric.  Also, my primary concern is that I live in Albany County, Wyoming...just outside of Laramie.  So the nights are long, the air is thin (7200 ft elevation), the wind blows 40 mph all winter, and temps down to -10F to -20F are common.*

Things I've already done:

\-Every single light bulb in the house is LED.

\-Roughly 85% or so of our electronics and appliances are less than 5 years old (some are less than a year old) and are Energy Star certified.

\-Fridge and Freezer are turned down to the minimum levels that I feel comfortable with...on dials of 7, the freezer is at 4 and the fridge is at 3.5).

\-I already plan on swapping out the current non-programmable digital thermostat with a programmable one this week.  It's currently been set anywhere from 68-70, as our nights have already begun to get pretty chilly and I'm kindof a pansy (in spite of being native to the area, lol).

\-Skirting on the trailer is good; it's a layer of 1/4 ply and then sheet metal over that.  On the windward side and around the water heater, there is also a layer of R-13 insulation behind that sheet metal and ply.

\-Windows and doors are all less than 10 years old and are double-paned; there doesn't seem to be any drafts anywhere and everything seems well-sealed.

\-We have heavy-duty blackout curtains by default because my wife works nights and sleeps during the day.  So that also helps with the windows and keeping in heat.

\-The majority of the house is sunlit all day.  Kinda sucked this summer when we first moved in, but it'll be advantageous in the winter for sure.

\-The majority (80%) of the house is carpeted, plus we have some area rugs.

\-We finally have a dishwasher (didn't have one before), which is far more water efficient than hand-washing from what I gather.  I do worry about power cost though.  It's not the newest dishwasher on the planet.  For now, I keep the heated dry option off, as I'm not sure how much more power that uses.

\-Vents have been vacuumed out and seem to push air quite well.

\-I sleep with a heavy blanket, and my three huskies tend to curl up with me as well.  Lol.

\-Washer and dryer are a little older, but not much I can do about that right now.

Am I missing anything simple/stupid or overlooking something obvious?  I'm fairly capable of minor improvements on my own, and we have a very easygoing landlord who has given the green light for pretty much any improvements we want to make (and will take most things off of the rent in reimbursement).  Having said that, I don't have a ton of cash flow for materials.

Any and all input or discussion is appreciated.  My apologies if this isn't the best sub for this, but it's huge and active and full of, well, DIYers like myself.  Lol."

Attaching casters with lag screws in the end of a 4x4,2,10,"Can I attach casters with lag screws into the end of a 4x4? I've been reading about it, and think it would be strong enough. If I predrill holes for the lag screws. Anything else I should look for?

I would be using 1/4"" lag screws, probably 3"" long, in the end of a 4x4 that is around 4-6"" long.

It is replacing 4 pieces of 2x2 in which fixed feet were previously mounted. Bolt pattern on the casters is 2.17""x1.67"" with four mounting holes each.

My other option was to put a t-nut in the top of the 4x4 and use a bolt. The top of the 4x4 would be flush with the bottom of the unit in either scenario."

Venting a dryer out a window.,7,16,"We've recently moved into a smallish flat in the city, and we have a relatively new, small electric dryer. The property doesn't come with any sort of space for the dryer specifically, but it fits perfectly under the large kitchen window. My question: is there any reason (safety specifically) that I can't just 'throw' the dryer vent out the window when I need to use it? The window is one of those big (5' x 2.5') windows that either swings open like a door or opens top down, so there's not really an option for building an insert. Alternatively, are the indoor condensors a real thing? I've read such mixed reviews for them that I'm pretty skeptical.

Painting Dresser and I need advice?,1,1,"I only painted furniture once, a few years ago I painted a small nightstand with just water-based primer and latex paint, it came out alright but the nightstand was a bit sticky. I left someone on my nightstand a few hours later when I remove it, it was slightly sticky. I am not sure if this is because I used way too much paint, or painted too early between layers.

Anyways Im looking to paint my dresser, its some sort of laminated MDF or Engineered wood. I already sanded it. I was looking for a sheen that is Eggshell or satin.

I was hoping it might be enough to use what I already have at home.

White Latex Satin Paint

White Latex Flat paint

White Acrylic Latex Paint + Primer in one

Zinsser Primer

Minwax water-based Polycrylic Satin Finish

Minwax water-based Polycrylic Satin Matte Finish

Tons of Brushes and rollers.

So far I was planning to just prime it and then afterward paint it. So a couple of questions.

1 - How many layers of primer are necessary? 

2 - Will latex paint and water-based primer be good enough for this or do I need to get oil?

3 - Do I need to use Polycrylic or will it be fine without it?

4 - If I use Polycrylic and if in the future I want to touch up some parts will I have to remove the Polycrylic or can I just paint over and use Polycrylic again over it?

5- If I should use Polycrillic should I use Flat Paint with Satin Polycrylic, or Satin paint with Satin Polycrylic, or Satin Paint with Matte Polycrylic? I wasnt sure if by using satin paint and satin Polycrylic the results will be too glossy for my taste.

6 - How do I avoid painted furniture feeling sticky? Is it sticky because of latex paint meaning oil paint doesnt cause stickiness? Or does stickiness come from applying it wrong?

Also, any other advice you can give me will be helpful also. Thanks."

Wood hot tub with epoxy?,1,10,"I was planning on building one and I was wondering if its viable to make a hot tub but instead of using jointers for the staves, youd use epoxy. Jointers for the wood is obviously good because as the wood absorbs water itll expand and form a seal on its own but I just really really dont want to deal with that for all the staves, and epoxy itself forms a watertight seal so I feel that just painting it in epoxy should be enough. Obviously the floor and the staves would be joined by a dado joint, and the entire thing would be held together via steel bands or cable.


I was also thinking of using 4 inch staves to give a good polygon look, the tub itself will be 4 feet in diameter.

Are there any obvious flaws Im missing?"

Here is where I am stuck and confused. 

How do I know what is code? I tried looking on my town's website for code, but nothing addresses what is proper code. Stud spacing? Distance from wall to furnace? What else do I need to look for?

Will I need to tear the wall down, get the permit and then rebuild it? Will the town ever know that I built the wall before the permit was issued?  Do they come inspect before the permit is issued? 

Sorry for being so naive, but I have never needed a permit before?

I'm trying to figure out the name of the texture, how it's done, any pointers you can give me. I thought maybe a skip trowel but the videos I can find aren't really the same thing. I'm really at a complete loss because I don't even know what it's called. I'm actually pretty handy with drywall finishing but this is something I've never run across.

LPT regarding weedeaters/string trimmers,3,2,"So yesterday I had a TIL moment regarding my weedeater that I thought I would pass along to all you fine folks in case you weren't aware.  Some weedeaters have a wheel on one end of the curved guide down near the powerhead, I never knew what it was for until I saw my neighbor edging his driveway and sidewalk with his weedeater.  The powerhead rotates and you can run the wheel along the ground and edge along your sidewalk to give your yard a nice finished look.  I'm so excited as I used to do this by hand with an edging tool and it took forever.  Since yesterday I think I have edged at least half my block and it looks gorgeous!  Hope someone out there finds this as useful as I did!"

I was driving home the other day and saw this by the side of the road. I think it must have been left outside on their back porch because the stain was chipping off. 

I used an electric sander and went to town. I assumed it was solid wood and unfortunately sanded too far into the veneer, exposing particle board in a few small places. I used a thin layer of wood filler over the exposed particle board and stained directly over it. I painted the base an antique white. 

Im pretty pleased with the final product.

My original intention was to lay a plywood base over the wooden subfloor to bring it level with the concrete, but 2mm plywood seems to be hard to get hold of in large enough sheets (presumably because it breaks up too easily). My two options now are to either lay different thicknesses of underlayment to bring the floor level, or to lay 3mm hardboard and sand a chamfer to the lip to at least reduce the difference in height. Am I missing a third option?"

I am not planning on selling/gifting the lamp but still want to be on the safe side. Most DIY-Lamp-Videos don't even talk about the Earth wire so I am a bit in doubt if it's correct to not attach the Earth wire.

Painting Garage Floor Advice,1,8,"Hello there wonderful community, I was prepping/planning out my project to paint my garage floor and I wanted to ask for advice on how should I move forward with this project? I have never done this before and I started to do my research online. Below is my understanding so far and if I am missing a step please share your thoughts because I want to do this right and not screw it up. 

**Things Need For This Project: (Home Depot my local shopping store)**

* Rust-Oleum Concrete Etch and Cleaner
* Rust-Oleum Cleaner and Degreaser
* Going with Behr (Slate Gray Self-Priming 1-Part Epoxy Satin Interior/Exterior Concrete and Garage Floor Paint)
* Broom and Brush
* Alots of time...

My garage floor condition is in its original form built back in 2007. The only thing that I see on the floor are stains of Paint and Oil. The oil stain has been there for a while so hoping the above to cleaning options remove them. 

Can you guys share your knowledge or recommend step-by-step on what needs to happen in what order?  I know it sounds pretty simple (Clean your garage and paint), but I want to make sure I follow what needs to be done so I get a good result. I also read that there is a minimum of 1 week because the car can be driven back into the garage, is this true?

Thank you to all for your time and help with this project, appreciate your help :)"

Patio sub base and other specs - I don't want to get screwed again,2,5,"Hi all,

TL;DR: How deep should a patio subbase be? All research online says 150mm (6"") my builders are saying as little as 15-20mm (0.6"" - 0.79"").

&#x200B;

Detail: I had a patio laid by cowboys years ago and rain water then damaged the sandstone house at the base. Now after a lot (A LOT) of research I've found a decent business in the area to replace it.

All the research online says the patio needs to have a sub base of 150mm (6"") and be 150mm below the damp course. I asked the builders about that and they said no way and said digging out 300mm (12"") would be a mammoth task (there's also an old tarmac path underneath they'd have to dig through doing this) and instead what they do is dig a 15-20mm (0.6"" - 0.79"") subbase.

&#x200B;

They said a 150mm subbase would be for cars or even lorries and that for foot traffic only 15mm-20mm is fine. Is that right? I've dug 5 test holes and the ground underneath is either dense rocky clay at the front and side of the house or the red/black brick hardcore the cowboys put in at the back of the house. There is more ground to fill at the back because it drops away into the garden so they used a lot of this red crushed brick material to build it up level.

&#x200B;

While I'm asking: They also want to put the patio only 50mm (2"") below the damp course but to compensate place it 100mm (4"") away from the wall with gravel in the gap to drain water away - plus a gentle slope away from the house for drainage.

&#x200B;

Does all this sound right? After spending thousands repairing the brickwork I really don't want to go through that again."

Shower Pan Replacement,1,9,"Hey all,

Was looking for some input as I am preparing to replace my shower pan. I do not want to re-tile my whole shower; I want this to be as minimally invasive as possible. I have done the research and my shower wall tile is extremely common, so it will be very easy to match it once I demo the floor / pan and knock out the bottom two rows of tiles or whatever is necessary to get the pan out.

My basic plan is as follows:

1. Knock out my shower floor tile, as well as the first two rows or so of tile up the wall (should give me almost 8 inches of clearance).
2. Remove the old shower pan.
3. Make sure my subfloor is level.
4. Apply thinset mortar, then place my prefab shower pan (something like Schluter Kerdi, cut to size) centered around the drain hole.
5. Apply waterproof membrane-- either a sheet membrane like Kerdi or Noble, or a liquid membrane like RedGuard.
6. Apply mortar as I lay the tile.

Is that the basic flow I should be keeping in mind, or am I missing something big? My other questions are as follows:

* Should I anticipate having to replace the drain, or is it possible I can sort of ""work around"" the current drain and keep it in place? If I have to replace, do you have any cheap recommendations for kits I should look into?
* What other major hurdles should I anticipate? Any particular resources you would say are ""must-watch"" or ""must-read""?

I am trying to keep this on as low of a budget as possible, but I do think it is worth spending the extra money on a prefab pan so I can eliminate some potential issues related to bad pitch, poor drainage, etc. I understand that can still happen, but I want to minimize the likelihood of that.

I appreciate any input you can give. Thanks in advance!"

Updated a pair of vintage Westnofa Siesta chairs.,199,24,"[Album here](https://imgur.com/a/KkvuaYT)

I found these two Westnofa Siesta chairs with a matching footstool on Craigslist for $80. I did some looking online and found that new canvas and laces from the [manufacturer](https://centuryhouseinc.com/product/siesta-chair-replacement-canvas-cord-kit/) are nearly $400 PER CHAIR.  Add the classic [Siesta leather cushions](https://centuryhouseinc.com/product/siesta-classic-high-back-chair-replacement-cushions/?cat=697) at another $1600-1900 EACH. 

Aaaaaand, that's a nope from me. 

PLAN B! I really liked the idea of a leather element to the chair so I decided to replace the canvas portion with leather. I purchased two sides of water buffalo leather from Tandy Leather (along with 130 brass grommets, the grommet tool, and a punch kit). Total cost from Tandy: $275-ish. Then another $15 at Home Depot for Paracord. I already had the stain and topcoat from a previous project so I'm counting that as free. Which brings me to a grand total of $370 for two beautiful chairs and a stool. WAY cheaper than the $5k+ for original parts. 

I was originally planning to DIY a linen cushion similar to the ones that originally come on the chair... and I may still do so in the future. But for now, I just have a down pillow on the seat and a faux-sheepskin over the back. It's surprisingly comfortable that way. The leather has more give to it than the canvas did so there is less need for cushioning. This was my first time working with leather. I learned a lot. There are certainly flaws, but overall I'm really happy with the final result."

Oven wont heat after element incorrectly fitted / short,1,3,"So I replaced the elements in our oven. While taking the old ones out i made sure to write down the wire ordering. Unfortunately due to a spare earth connection when fitting the new elements I messed it up. The oven is a 14yo Britannia E10T (UK).

One of the Grill element connections was connected to earth. Testing the oven everything worked. Testing the grill element caused the RCD to trip. On resetting the hob and small oven still work but none of the main oven functionality does.

I'm really not sure where to start here. It feels like -

- It cant be anything in the power supply or nothing would work.
- It cant be an element or some of the oven functionality would work.

This leaves three potential culprits -
- The main oven function control box.
- The main oven temperature selector
- A fuse. I only see two thermal fuses - is it possible these went?

Anything else I should be looking at?

Part of Self-Leveling Cement Still Soft After One Day,3,7,"My wife and I put down self-leveling cement to level our living room floor after our foundation was repaired a year and a half ago. We had structural engineers come out and give us the go ahead that movement had stopped, so we want to put laminate flooring down.

We put down the SLC on a clean and primed concrete subfloor.

Now that the SLC has cured, we definitely have parts that need to be grinded down/filled in. I knew it wasn't going to be perfect, and I accept that.

But there is another area that has me more concerned. The last bucket that we poured ended up curing white instead of the dark grey like the rest. And after 20 hours, while the rest of the SLC job has hardened, this last bucket is still soft. You can walk on it without sinking in, but you leave a footprint on the surface when you do. It isn't deep, just a cosmetic footprint. And walking on it barefoot, it definitely feels damp.

Also, when I tried to sweep up, the broom actually ended up sanding down the soft surface. And when that happens, the white top layer reveals a grayer lower level that is more in-line with the coloring on the rest of the floor. I tried my hand with sanding one section by hand with rough sand paper, and it didn't take long to get to a lower level that wasn't soft (could tell by the sound of the sandpaper).

I don't think I used extra water on this bucket. If I did, it wasn't much. I am wondering if I just got a bad bag on that last pour, that had the wrong ratio of cement/fibers etc.

At this point, do I need to just sand up that bad bucket and start over? Or should I give it more time to see if it cures and dries out a little more?"

Help with light fittings - no base plate! (UK),1,7,"So weve just moved into our first bought flat and the owners have taken their light fittings (which weirdly seemed to be mostly chandeliers!) with them. Thats fine, but they seem to have left us with something quite annoying. Which is that all four lights have a pendant that is just hanging by the wires from the ceiling, and the pendant obviously wont secure to the ceiling as there is no base/support plate for it to click into. Im very confused because every website Ive been on regarding light fittings seems to assume there is a plate to fix the pendant too... can anyone help?

How can I fix skirting board to wall thats not straight and the tiles dont go far enough?,1,5,"Hi all. Looking for help how I can sort a problem with attaching skirting to drywall, that is slightly not straight. 

Images here - https://imgur.com/a/CmYU1RV

Weve had the bathroom tiled and it appears the tiles dont go near enough to the wall for the skirting to fit without a gap. If I push the skirting towards the wall, then it falls down a tony gap thats created because the tiles dont go close enough (second image).  In this case there is both a gap at the tiles 5mm and also at the wall 15mm. 

If I pull the skirting board off the wall a little, so it is covering the tiles, then there is an even bigger gap of around 20mm (first image). 

How can I try to minimise the gap so the skirting board looks better?

I cant do new drywall as its out the question, and I dont think cutting tiles is an option either. 

Thanks

Barn Door Dilemma -- Sizing?,2,1,"For logistical reasons, we want to change out a traditional door for a barn door, but the size is a bit odd. The interior of the frame is 36'' x 80ish'', but the trim takes it to 42.5'' x 84'' (approx.), and due to the lack of space on either side of the door, we'll probably need a double door. 

The closest sized double barn doors I've seen at Lowes and Home Depot are 42'' x 84''. The next two sizes are 48'' x 80'' \[too short\] and 60'' x 84'' \[wider than we'd like\]. This leads me to believe we're probably going to need to get a little creative. So far we've come up with two possible solutions:

1. Use two 24'' x 84'' barn doors to make our own double door. The hold up here is the price. The best I can figure, using two separate doors is going to basically double our cost, even though doors sold as double doors aren't really any more expensive. Ew.
2. Build our own door. We're fairly handy, so it's not a huge deal breaker. We just aren't completely sure where to start. I would assume we buy a barn door hardware kit or the components of it (we'll cross that bridge if we need to) and then build our own door \[slab doors are apparently only available in 80'' or 96''\]. I just don't know if there's a ""best"" material or blueprint for one. The door is for a laundry room, if that makes any difference to you. 

I'm hoping someone has had a similar experience or has some advice they'd like to share. Honestly anything from where to buy pair of cheap doors to tips on building your own door would be appreciated. Thanks!!"

Need advice hanging new TV on existing mount,1,9,"Quick Background:

When we moved into our house there was a TV and speaker system already installed above the fireplace. The TV that's up there is HEAVY and I want to swap it out with a TV that I already owned. I don't want to remove the mount that is on my wall because it's already installed and centered above the fireplace and feels heavy duty.

[Here is a link to the mount](https://www.peerless-av.com/collections/display-tv-mounts/products/sp850?variant=29193755787379).

[You can see in this photo](https://imgur.com/a/rMQcexW) that the arm part is already installed on my wall (VESA 200x100).

[This part](https://imgur.com/a/6BjIuAz) is attached to my OLD TV after removing it from the arm of the mount. This appears to be VESA 700x300 and as you can see it is fixed at that size and will not attach to my NEW TV with VESA 400x400 holes.

What is the cheapest/easiest way I can get my new TV up? I have been searching the vendors website but can't find anything that will work. Amazon is overwhelmingly full of ""universal"" mounting plates that don't seem to fit my situation. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

Question - Sink Drain Sump Pump Runs Continuously,4,4,"In my laundry room, we have a utility sink (which the Washing Machine drains into as well). 

The sink drains via a small sink drain sump pump under the sink. The brand is Aqua pro. 

We had a new washing machine delivered and installed by the delivery men today. Now the sump pump is running continuously. 

It will pump every 15 seconds even though there is no water in the sink and it hasn't run for hours.

I have no idea how sump pumps actual function. Any advice for what might be causing this to run continuously? I have read that it could be due to lint/debris that got into the pump which makes sense since we just changed units. How do I clean the pump out?

One day I had an idea: what if I could do a REAL COOL guitar out of RAMEN NOODLES?

Why ramen (the most famous one here is called ""Doshirak"")? Around 15 years ago I used to really love it, well, you know, 90s was a weird time. And then, the childhood trauma kicked in :)

And of course I saw these videos about making really beautiful tables out of resin, and that famous video about the guitar made out of pencils, which was pretty sick!

Then I thought, why not to stick with these ideas, but to do this in a better way  my way? And heres the result  please, watch the video and let me know what you think! Feel free to ask any questions about this project!)

Shower Fix Needed :),3,6,"Hi all

&#x200B;

Hoping someone can give me some new advice.

I have a Mira ATL Advance shower that has recently started cutting out after running for about 90 seconds. IU did my research and was told it may be a faulty TCO (thermal cut out) causing it to turn off for safety reasons. I replaced the thermal compound on the TCO first, but this had no effect. I then replaced the TCO completely, but this also had no effect. I've also had the shower running on the coldest setting possible, but have found that the shower still cuts out, causing me to think that there must be something else faulty...

On the cut out, the shower lights completely turn off...no flashing error lights.

Before I go out and buy anything new, does anyone have any suggestions?

Power surge killing the HVAC motherboard,3,14,"I manage an older duplex where each unit has a separate breaker box fed by two independent 220v lines.

None of the breakers tripped, but I had two surge protectors and an HVAC motherboard blow out downstream on the affected circuit.  The power company explains this as a ""floating ground""  where an unintended ground after the breaker completed the circuit and pushed too much power into the circuit resulting in the surge.  Is there any reason a homeowner couldn't install a sacrificial fuse right before the power supply to the HVAC unit in such a way to prevent damage from any future surge?

I could replace the baseboard, but it will be a bit of a struggle because a portion is behind a closet door casing, which I will then need to remove.

I thought one way to solve the issue is to bevel the bottom edge to the same thickness as the baseboard. It works, but is not as visually appealing.

Would anyone have some better suggestions?

Cinder block anchor question,1,11,"Hello all! I am going to hang some old kitchen cabinets on the walls of my detached, cinder block garage. I intend to mount a French cleat to the wall first, then mount smaller cleat sections to the back of each cabinet so that it can be reconfigured later if my needs change. To the best of my knowledge, the block cavities are hollow. I'm just not sure tapcons will hold the weight of loaded cabinets on a cleat. I have any tool I might need to do this, I just don't know what type of anchor to use to attach the cleat. Please help!"
Help removing a door knob,2,6,"I am changing the door knobs in my house to door handles. I have removed 8 so far with no problems, however there is one door knob that will just not come off. The problem is when I press in the knob release button, the knob won't slide off (essentially at the 20 second mark in this video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wg4dKFlmdB0 ).
It is not a hex screw type release, it is a button. I can see & feel the button depress when I put a small nail in there, however the knob will not pull off (unlike the other 8 I've done!)

Are there any other suggestions to get this removed?"

Repairing Knob on Bathtub that won't turn off completely,0,8,"I'm trying to repair one of the knobs on my bathtub that wasn't turning off completely prior to removing the outside and turning the rest with a wrench.    From the looks of it, the plastic/rubber portion on the inside snapped between the knob and the main section.  I've been checking guide and videos but I can't seem to find any that has the same set up as mine.   From my understanding, this plastic portion is the cartridge and it looks like it  should just pull out and replace.  Tried gripping it with an adjustable wrench, but it's in their pretty tight.  I didn't want to pull too hard and make it worse.

Anyone know if I'm on the right track or if I'm way off?  If so, any suggestions?

Bending door hinges with black finish,1,3,"We recently had our old stained wood doors, frames and trim work painted white. When all the doors were off we also replaced the old brass hardware with new door hinges and knobs with a black finish. 

Looks great but now all the doors need to be adjusted and nothing closes right. 

Ive seen the method where you can realign the doors by removing the hinge pin and bend the knuckles using an adjustable wrench.  This trick should fix most of my door alignment issues. 

My question is - what can I do to protect the knuckles from being marred by wrench? I tried it on one and the black finish ended up scrapping off in parts."

Bought a house and need advice for painting baseboard,1,2,
Another guy looking to do a DIY wood fire pizza oven,1,8,"Saw the Ooni Karu and other Ooni products. I loved the thought of having a larger than conventional oven, as well as the high heat wood produces. Looking at a bunch of DIY pizza ovens on youtube made me wonder what's the point of making it yourself if the oven is too small, or you have to scrape out the embers to use it. I mostly focused on the people who made them for very little money, less than $200, as I would like to spend less than $150 if possible.

&#x200B;

I looked up the ratios, how the dome height should be 75% of the diameter of the inside of the oven, the opening should be 63%, but I didn't see anything on the width of the opening. I'd like to do 18"" pizzas on occasion, or long baguettes that are 18-20"", so I'd like my opening to be that wide. So I was thinking about doing a 32"" diameter oven with a 24"" height, 20.16"" H x 20"" W opening (arched?). If I want have the space to be able to do an 18"" pizza, maybe the inside should be about 36 - 40"" instead? 

&#x200B;

The trade off, I think, is that the larger oven would take a longer time to heat, so I might be less inclined to use it if it becomes a hassle to heat every time. If I do more 10-16"" pizzas, and 18"" baguettes, I think 32"" would be fine.. 

&#x200B;

So, with that being said, a few questions: 

1. For anyone who's done this, have you used it as often, more, or less than you had initially planned?
2. What kinds of things have you found you cook more?
3. What was the total amount you spent?
4. What size oven did you decide to make? 
5. Are you glad you went through with it?
6. Is there anything you would have done differently after the fact?"

When making some small tester pilot holes to use a stud or anchor, I couldn't quite tell what it was.  It felt like drywall for the initial part, then instead of being hollow, either had more drywall or something slightly harder.  I drilled about 1 1/8th inch deep, and the total thickness from inside drywall to the outside siding is maybe 5.5""

The rest of my rooms either have drywall + hollow or drywall + stud (much harder to drill through, obviously).

I opened the electrical outlet on this wall and included a picture, couldn't quite tell as there are only two holes on the back top and bottom left, but I see a little bit of maybe fiberglass insulation?

Is this a double drywall? Or have I reached whatever is on the outside of the house under the siding?

It was built in 1989 in Maryland.  Due to the location of the vents and length of the rods, we need to mount them within an inch of these locations. Also, there's a middle supporting section that seems to have the same majeup.  So what can I use here?

I tried two different stud finders and they weren't within a foot of where I need to mount."
Questions for Contractors/Insulators,1,3,"I have a walkout basement that I am finishing and am looking for some advise on insulating and framing the wall where part of the wall is below grade and part is above.

As is the case with walkouts, the part above ground is framed with 2x4 studs and the part below is concrete. This creates a ridge / ledge where the base plate of the framed part meets the concrete foundation. I want to frame the wall so that I don't have the ridge in the wall.

I am in southern Ontario, Canada so climate zone 6 for US and 2 for Canada.

My question is regarding the insulation and vapour barrier for this. Please see the attached picture (apologies for it being rotated).

There is the exterior brick wall, then the sheathing and then the stud framing. I would like to put 1.5"" foam board in between the studs against the sheathing (sealed with spray foam) and on the concrete foundation. Then I would like to frame a 2x4 wall to eliminate the ridge.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/hmrcjjlc2tn31.jpg

My question is that there is likely a 4"" - 6"" gap in between the foam board set between the studs and the outside of the new framed wall. I am planning on adding 1 layer of fiberglass batt insulation followed with a vapour barrier, but if that still leaves a gap, should I add an additional layer of insulation and then the vapour barrier?

Hiding faucet plumbing in the floor/well,5,3,"I am installing new bathroom cabinets in my parents' house.  The house is ~40 years old and all the plumbing for the sinks comes out of the floor directly under the sinks.  I am thinking about redoing the plumbing so that it comes out of the wall under the sinks.  [Here is a primitive illustration.](https://i.imgur.com/nJY9abR.png)

My plumbing experience is novice.  I know how to sweat/solder copper pipes but I don't have a torch nor do I have solder.  Typically I use sharkbite when doing repairs.  However I do have experience drywalling and framing, so that isn't an issue.

My concern is that accessing the piping in the floor is going to be a pain (especially to solder), so I was wondering if I can use a compression fitting or some other piping / connector to make the job easier to move the piping into the wall framing?  Any thoughts / tips / pitfalls?

Building a cobblestone path. Should I use mortar?,4,7,"I'm about to lay a cobblestone path. I've got a few inches of gravel laid down. I'm using reclaimed bricks that have not been cleaned of mortar. I am in New York.

My options are:

* Lay the bricks as they are and put sand between the spaces in the mortar.
* Lay the bricks as they are and use mortar to fill the gaps.
* Clean the bricks entirely, lay them, and put sand between the now smaller gaps.

I was originally planning on doing #3 above, however it takes about a minute to clean each brick, and I've got about a thousand bricks to lay. My wife suggested #2, but I'm worried that the mortar will be unable to set or will just look like garbage. I think #1 would actually look better than #2, but it might still look bad.

How to time Halloween lights when my outlet is only 1ft above the ground,3,15,"Sorry for the super simple question- Im a total dunce when it comes to electrical stuff and I just want to make sure Im not going to fry my landlords circuits or anything if it starts raining. Just got some outdoor Halloween lights and strung them up and realized that because they dont come with an on/off switch I have to just leave the plugs hanging out when Im not using them which already seems ominous- so I figured Id invest in a light timer. But all of the outdoor timers say they need to be positioned vertically at least 2 ft above the ground and my outlet is only 1 foot above the floor of my balcony. And because the timers themselves look a tad long I think when I plug the lights into them theyre going to be practically laying on the ground which I can tell wasnt the intended position. Whats the worst that could happen if I just use the light timer anyway- am I risking my landlords electrical system or merely risking ruining my own lights? And also what are my options? Im on the second floor so I dont see standing water being an issue but I want to make sure Im doing this right and not risking anything important.

Thank you."

\- Leaving as-is and sealing it with some clear coat.

\- Trying to get the brushed alu look + clear coat.

\- Painting black + clear coat.

\- Painting gunmetal grey + clear coat.

If some one else has a completely different idea let me know.

I am hoping to hire a contractor to possibly insulate 1 or 2 rooms in house so I have somewhere to hide during the concert days. Online articles suggest adding an additional room inside my current room with rockwool insulation or MLV. Is this the best option?  Do you think I will need to add another ceiling and floor layer as well? How do I handle the windows in the room as I can't realistically wall them off? The house is brand new construction for what it's worth.

I'm willing to spend up to 20K if it means no sound will make it through to the insulated rooms.

Diy Electric Scooter Petrol to Electric Conversion and Modification,21,6,"Hi

In this project, I have taken an old petrol scooter and converted it to the electric green vehicle and heavily modified it. The entire project was a fun build and I hope you guys will love this project.

## [https://youtu.be/Y4fkVko8Jpw](https://youtu.be/Y4fkVko8Jpw)

## Step 1: Look of the Vehicle Before and After

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/g3ytv3ekoln31.png

https://i.redd.it/07vbb52toln31.png

https://i.redd.it/bf4e3ocpoln31.png

https://i.redd.it/1lcu1ozyoln31.png

I took the old vehicle of type automatic scooter of TVS make here in India form Indian manufacturer. The vehicle was in very bad shape. I stripped down the entire vehicle up to chassis and worked entirely on its chassis.

## Step 2: Removing All Internal Combustion Engine Parts and Body Parts and Custom Parts

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/s2v04jpcpln31.png

https://i.redd.it/0hyctg0epln31.png

https://i.redd.it/pikjpfefpln31.png

I removed all the Internal combustion engine parts like head block, piston, crankshaft, air filter, magneto assembly to name few of them. Also, all the body parts were removed and all custom parts as shown in the picture were made. Some parts were made by cutting old body panels of the company and the rest was made from the 6inch PVC pipes after heating it and molding it and got it colored white

## Step 3: Engine Electrification and Custom Parts

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6uam9yjppln31.png

An adapter plate from aluminum was made to fix the motor on the fan side of the crankcase as shown in the above picture. A custom crankshaft was also made out of the iron bar because we do not want the offset weight to rotate unnecessarily and imbalance the entire system as there is no need of one as there is no piston in the electric engine. As seen in the pictures the custom shaft will couple from fan side to the motor with the toothed nylon transmission geared drive. The adapter plate will get mounted from the fan side of the engine as seen in the picture. Also, the 3000w BLDC motor and steel plate to seal the empty went of engine block place is shown as above.

## Step 4: Assembling the Electric Engine

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/sqqo9kxupln31.png

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/56ynsph0qln31.png

https://i.redd.it/qibcy9w1qln31.png

The electric engine assembly was then started. The motor was mounted on the adapter plate. Connecting gears mounted on both motor and driveshaft. The well-greased nylon coupler is then inserted in between the shaft and motor. The motor is then placed in the alignment of the driveshaft and is bolted firmly on to the crankcase body of the engine. On the opposite side, we will get the output of the shaft and here I have removed the automatic variable drive or so-called CVT drive as its really very lossy drive and I did not want to lose a single watt in that. The rear reduction gearbox was kept intact and the shaft was modified to have a key slot to fix pulleys on front and rear shafts. The tensioner pulley was fixed at the center and it was then given appropriate tension on the belt drive.

## Step 5: Finalizing the Electric Engine

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/5w3a1x1aqln31.png

https://i.redd.it/ksitkykbqln31.png

The CVT side engine cover was again fixed at a place to protect the belt drive. Steel plate was fixed at the empty place from where engine block was removed so that dust and other environmental things do not get inside the engine compartment. The wheel was fixed and the stand was also installed on which the electric engine is parked.

## Step 6: Installing the Engine to Frame and Battery

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/zg906knjqln31.png

https://i.redd.it/rdaic92lqln31.png

https://i.redd.it/euom1o7mqln31.png

The engine was then mated to frame. All custom body panels were installed and as shown in the picture the uneven surfaces of the luggage compartment were flattened with the grinder to make it level to accommodate 12v 28Ah four batteries in the bay.

## Step 7: The Final Out Come

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wz5jz4srqln31.png

https://i.redd.it/fs3rguguqln31.png

&#x200B;

Agile look is given to the previously soft-looking traditional scooter. I think that we were able to make it look like that quite successfully. So what do you guys think do let me know your views.

&#x200B;

## Step 8: Lets Take It for a Spin

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/lh8pnd10rln31.png

&#x200B;

Guys the scooter is really very very fun machine to ride. It has ample power to propel the scooter at the speed of about 55Kmph. Feels sturdy and safe to ride. The entire video is available on youtube. If you are interested in how it performs on road do take a look at it. I have placed English subtitles in the video so that though it's in Hindi you will be able to understand the content of the entire video. I hope that you loved reading this instructable. I am thankful for reading this till the end and comment from all of you will really be a matter of appreciation to the hard work. Thank you all."

Is it possible to make this cleaner/disinfectant by myself? And does it really work?,3,18,"Ok, I don't know if this is the correct sub to post this. I searched a little but could not find something that would fit more, since r/chemistry seems to be something more focused on the science itself and more professional area. So please forgive me if this is not allowed here.

I have recently heard about [this product](https://www.treehugger.com/cleaning-organizing/force-nature-turns-tap-water-powerful-green-cleaner.html) that claims to be an ""electrolyzed water"", ""an all-purpose cleaner and disinfectant that's as effective on glass as Windex and as good as Formula 409 and Clorox Clean Up on oil and grease"" that ""contains two potent ingredients  sodium hydroxide, which is a suds-free detergent and grease-cutter found here in a concentration of 0.0000003% (although some major brands contain up to 5%), and hypochlorous acid, which cleans and deodorizes as effectively as bleach"" made only by adding electricity to a solution composed of water, salt and vinegar.

Apparently they sell capsules with the mixture (just add it to tap water) and an electrolyzer (in which you put the solution).

So, considering that the article explicitly and directly cites these common ingredients (water, salt, vinegar and electricity) and that you can prepare/finish preparing the solution at home I think that would be possible to also make it but without buying it (even because I live in Brazil and this product is not available here). Is that possible and, if it is, what would be the concentration for each ingredient and how to add the electricity without causing an electrical short circuit (I'm not planning on inserting two wires in the wall power plug and putting it in a bowl with the mixture lol)? Also, is there an ideal current to apply to it?

Thanks in advance."

Is hardboard ok for front facing DIY.,15,8,"So I'm building/almost finished a understairs cupboard. I made the frame out of softwood and the doors/shelves out of 18mm thick MDF. All has gone pretty well and I'm starting to look at how to finish it up and make it look nice. It's going to be white. Now I've painted the outside facing parts of the frame white as a tester and to be honest it doesn't look as great (I guess because its just construction style softwood timber. So I was thinking of cutting some strips of something to put on top of the timber, just something thin. I have enough left over 3mm Hardboard which I used for boxing in and considering that. Hard board being the pretty flexible shiny on one side and I dunno how to describe the other side....corky??? 

[You can see some in my picture here.](https://ibb.co/rZPthhH) Including the white parts of the frame I'm talking about (diagonal and vertical white struts you can see.

Reason why i ask is whenever I see any description of hardboard its always just to say its good for boxing in, rear of cupboards and putting under floors. I wonder if anyone would use it for the front and paint it.  This is just to save me having to buy some plywood which I'll saw into strips instead.

Another reason for covering up is as you can see from the pic I have a slight gap between the diagonal strut and my stairs that is really annoying!

Thanks in advance."

Shower Flow Help!,9,14,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently living with my grandparents, who have a relatively old bathtub faucet/shower combo:

https://i.imgur.com/zoyHYZj.jpg

However water flow is pretty pitiful with the shower hose attached to the riser on the wall. I replaced the old shower hose with an 11mm bore, 1.5m length hose, and found a small improvement, however, I still am finding disappointing flow results:

From the faucet itself: 4.5gpm
With the hose (no incline): 2.64gpm (40% reduction from previous)
With the hose (lowest usable incline): 1.3gpm (51% ""        "")
Hose at max incline: 0.5gpm (62% reduction ""         "")

Overall a 90% drop in flow from faucet to top of the hose. **All of these are taken without a shower head**

Regarding possible solutions, my biggest constraint is that I am not allowed to do any permanent fixture changes in the bathroom, and considering the bathtub side panel is sealed in on all 4 sides, I can pretty much only work with what I've got. Using my poorly remembered physics and mechanics, I can think of a few ways to fix it, but I wanted some advice on their feasibility: 

* Attach a shorter, 1m hose to reduce total distance travelled.
* Go for an even wider bore, say 13mm.
* Attach a magic shower head that can make 1.3gpm usable for showering.
* Lastly, find some sort of travel or camping pump that can used and recharged. I found one that seems relatively easy, but unfortunately requires it to be submersed - Is there some sort of in-line equivalent?

Any other suggestions or recommendations would be very helpful here!

Thanks!"

Help mounting monitor arm... on brick,2,24,"So I recently got a big display tablet for drawing and since my desk is made of glass I thought of getting a wall monitor arm instead of a desk arm for which I would have to buy a new desk that could hold the weight. 

We thought the wall was concrete (on the surface it's just your regular white painted wall) but soon after we started drilling the white powder ended and red dust started coming out of the holes.

We tried mounting it with the regular plastic anchors that came with the set (we really don't know what we're doing) and as we are tightening the screws we realized that not only was the wall brick but also that the screws are way too long and soon we hit a hollow space behind the brick layer itself. The screw already has a tendency to come loose but the hollow space making it tip over is even worse.

We attempted to add a wooden board in front of the wall to make up for the hollow space and it seemed perfect until we tried putting some weight onto the arm, and the top screw started to loosen (the wall also seems to be more rigid on the lower portion). 

Since the arm has to be able to come across the desk safely is there ever going to be a way that the wall will hold the weight? The display is 16 lbs plus the adapter and the arm itself. Any clarifications or suggestions would be aprecciated."

Leaky P trap under vanity,2,14,"We recently upgraded to a double sink vanity and after all of the plumbing upgrades came the ""easy part"", the P trap. I have taken them off and tried to fit them better and finally, after using ""pipe dope"" as my pipe fitter father calls it (PVC sealer or something like that) I finally got one of the sinks to stop leaking. I put the sealer on the second sink but it still leaks. It is only leaking where the drain pipe from the sink hooks up to the first part of the P trap. I would love any tips or tricks to get it to drink the dirty water instead of spitting it out into a large bowl under the trap. It is not a big leak by any means but it is there. Thanks in advance!"

Ethernet run from basement to first floor,7,31,"Folks - I am finishing my basement and as part of this wanted to do a home run of Ethernet to the av rack from upstairs office. I found a jack through which the Verizon cable comes. When I followed it downstairs it came through the basement. So I thought I could use this hole without drilling a new one. However on trying I found that the wire is too thick to enter this. So I had to make another hole from the basement right next to it. After several unsuccessful tried using drill bits upto a 1/2 inch I still couldn't get the wire through. I finally had to use a 11/16 paddle bit to drill the hole and feed the wire. However on doing so since I was working with limited view into what is on the other side upstairs I ended up poking a hole in the baseboard molding. Everything is now wired and stuff but this unsightly hole is left behind on baseboard molding. Can you please help me on what I need to do to patch this hole up? Pictures below.

"Advice Request - Paint-pros, this paint won't spread at all. Bad brand, or inherent?",4,6,"Hello DIYers,

In a nutshell: I have [this acrylic latex](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Valspar-Satin-Perfect-White-Latex-Paint-Actual-Net-Contents-128-fl-oz/1000069149) paint. I really like how hard it dries, but it doesn't seem to cover well and it doesn't seem to flow/spread well AT ALL! With those two properties, I need multiple coats for coverage but it's a PITA to apply those coats because it spreads so poorly. This stuff is thick. Kind of like honey-thick. Does this specific brand suck or is it just the way acrylic latex is? 

&#x200B;

Not in a nutshell: I'm currently doing some last minute painting to get our house ready to put on the market. I previously had some paint stick and peel off of doors where they meet the jamb. Through some google-fu, I found that latex paints dry somewhat tacky and continue to have a tacky feel to them for days/weeks, which can cause peeling like I had on paint-to-paint surfaces. The solution was to use latex formulas that had acrylic added to their formulas, which results in a much harder finish. I had to do some trim in a laundry closet as well as paint the interior of the space. I figured even though it's trim paint, I'll just throw it on the walls too so I don't have to go buy more paint. I expected it to cover amazingly given how thick it was. The coverage was terrible and it was so horrible to spread. I ended up using an entire gallon to cover a 3x8 closet. Since there was a lot of new drywall and spackle, I thought maybe those surfaces were just very porous and sucked up a lot of paint. Well, now I am doing the closet doors and other trim so I bought another gallon. This gallon too spreads terribly. It's taking me forever to paint one side of a panel door. I just don't know if this is the way all acrylic latex paints are and I just need to deal with it or if it is inherent to this particular brand. I don't want to waste money buying another brand if it's going to be more of the same."

Should I use molybdenum disulfide grease?,3,11,"I know molybdenum disulfide grease/paste isn't suitable for all applications so I want to make sure it's the correct choice for my application before proceeding.

The application is hardened steel shafts sliding in an aluminum housing (machined cast aluminum with some porosity). No bearing/bushing material whatsoever (poor design, I know, but it's what I have to work with). The movement is purely low-speed axial sliding, zero rotation. There's a segment on each shaft that has grooves for detent pins. The pins and grooves are both hardened steel but I suspect the tips of the pins and the crests of the detent grooves are worn well-through the case hardening so my primary concern is minimizing additional wear on the detent grooves and pins. Secondary concern is smooth movement in the aluminum housing. I'm certain the shafts experience occasional side loading but I have no idea how high the loads are and for what duration. The parts make up the shifter assembly of a transmission which is exposed to splash lubrication so contamination of the gear oil needs to be considered (ball, roller, and needle bearings are present as well as an external fluid pump and heat exchanger but no syncros to worry about \[dog box\]). Is this a suitable application for moly paste? The stuff I have on hand is Loctite LB8012 (65% MoS2 supposedly)."

Workshop exhaust fan question,3,4," 

Hello all,

I have a question that I've been having a really rough time finding an answer to.

First a bit of background,

I  bought a house last year and I'm finally moving my focus onto my  detached garage/workshop. It used to be used as a racecar shop back in  the early 00's.  It's a diamond in the rough in terms of cleanliness and  current function, but I'm slowly making progress. I'm currently having a  good buddy run new electrical, running plumbing from the house, and  cleaning up the years of neglect.   **One of the things that I've noticed  is that it gets HOT in the daytime, with crazy humidity during the day.**   **A little information about the  shop - Metal construction, half insulated with  Styrofoam boards (some falling off), facing South (doors) with no real shade. The shop is  40' x 30'.**

On to the question...

It  has a 40"" x 36"" exhaust fan on the top of the east wall, which has a  belt-driven motor on it.  GE motor without any identifying marks.  The  motor hums when turned on, won't turn and pops the breaker within 10  seconds.  The CB is 20 amp and the fan was pulling over 50+ amps when  the breaker popped.  I did find that the fan was a bit old and rusty - I  broke it loose where it can freely move now but with the same result.   I'm probably just gonna cut my loses on the motor itself and order a new  one.  But I'm having a really hard time finding information on sizing.   I was thinking about something like this [https://www.amazon.com/Leeson-110088-Single-Agricultural-Motors/dp/B00BC7YLZK/ref=pd\_rhf\_se\_s\_vtp\_ses\_clicks\_shared\_1\_2/138-7631580-1627844?\_encoding=UTF8&pd\_rd\_i=B00BC7YLZK&pd\_rd\_r=151fd6f8-6fdc-4297-827e-f858a2939563&pd\_rd\_w=XmErp&pd\_rd\_wg=EFtJF&pf\_rd\_p=fc133098-0fe0-425e-be82-4e2e411bf8ca&pf\_rd\_r=GQBGVNEAVVPFA4ABHGCZ&psc=1&refRID=GQBGVNEAVVPFA4ABHGCZ](https://www.amazon.com/Leeson-110088-Single-Agricultural-Motors/dp/B00BC7YLZK/ref=pd_rhf_se_s_vtp_ses_clicks_shared_1_2/138-7631580-1627844?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00BC7YLZK&pd_rd_r=151fd6f8-6fdc-4297-827e-f858a2939563&pd_rd_w=XmErp&pd_rd_wg=EFtJF&pf_rd_p=fc133098-0fe0-425e-be82-4e2e411bf8ca&pf_rd_r=GQBGVNEAVVPFA4ABHGCZ&psc=1&refRID=GQBGVNEAVVPFA4ABHGCZ)

*But  I seriously have no idea if that would be under-powered, overkill, or  if it would work in this application at all.  Do I need a separate start  capacitor or is that built-in? Cut-off switch?  Should I run it on a  timer, or just 24/7 to keep it ventilated? How much electricity does  this thing really use - my shop is on its own power meter and the first  25$ is included.*

I really do appreciate any help.  I'll leave it to the experts."

AC Unit crapped out,75,53,"So last night my AC unit stopped cooling my home. I thought it was odd, considering the nights in Georgia are much cooler than the days, and it ran fine all day. I replaced the air filter, because I have been sending hardwoods, and even though I covered the returns while sanding, dust could have clogged up the filter.  So, I set the thermostat to ON instead of auto, and head out to work. 

At some point during the day, my wife shut the thermostat off. When I get home, I put the thermostat to auto, and now the outdoor condenser won't start on it's own. I cleaned off the coils, and can get the condenser unit running if I push start the fan.  After about 10-15 minutes I notice a hissing noise. Not high pitched, but it is constant. It stops when I shut off the unit, but starts again if I restart it. I've tested the power, all looks good, 250 volts to unit, continuity across all the connectors for the capacitors. All I notice is a humming noise when the condenser is trying (unsuccessfully) to start on it's own, and hissing/kinda electrical smell when I get it running.  

At this point I'm stumped and kinda out of ideas."

Vibrating washing machine makes things fall off,1,19," 

Hi DIY!!

So I have a tiny apartment. Most people have more storage space in their cars than I have in my apartment. :) Id like to maximize what I have.

(More background: college student, so assume broke, yes, but not completely broke (because of all the money I save on my tiny apartment). Also assume I dont know the names of tools or how to do much more than use a drill. Im willing to learn though, and have friends that can help. If I need a professional, your idea is likely a bit outside the scope of what Im looking to pursue.

I have a stacked washer/dryer with plenty of room on top of it. As expected, when I put boxes on top of this, they sometimes fall due to the vibrations from the washer/dryer running.

I can fit a lot up there, so I need to sit down and take the time to figure out the way to do this. Ive played with quite a few ideas. Ill spare you the really bad ones.

First, here is a picture.

[https://imgur.com/a/RlvBBTY](https://imgur.com/a/RlvBBTY)

What I want to do is secure large storage bins to the top of the dryer, or above the dryer\*.

Example storage bins.

[https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/)

Others would be fine too if any advantages.

I want to be able to take the entire storage bin off the top to interact with the contents. Ideally Id stack two but Ill either have to test to make sure the top couldnt get thrown off/is locked in tightly enough, or also secure the top bin separately.

My best (pls dont laugh) idea so far is to attach a hook to each wall. (Marked by the red xs in my pic. The left x is meant for the shower wall, not the back wall.) Then drill a small hole into each side of the bin. Then some of caribiner / detachable rope / dog leash, cut to length. Unhook, take it down. Rehook, it will move around when washer/dryer on, but cannot fall.

[https://imgur.com/a/EjVii2s](https://imgur.com/a/EjVii2s)

Similar alternatives include a rope or bungie cord across the front but not actually attached. The bin cant fall off, but Id have to lift it over instead of detaching (not a problem, but the installation of this doesnt really seem any better/easier). Or even something like a 2/4 installed across (this just seems like it would be uglier).

Shelves seem like a fail, as theyd be quite far back. I also dread the installation. Will admit there are some clear advantages though and could be convinced.

\*As I was editing this post, I realized its on top or ABOVE the dryer. Perhaps the best option is installing a platform that rests on the shower-wall and attaches to the right wall. The advantage being that nothing moves at all when using washer/dryer. Which means no need to drill into/find a way to attach bins, and easier to get them down and back up. Plus I could definitely stack them. This seems like a much better idea if I can teach myself how to install something like this.

Open to totally different ideas, as well as implementation ideas/products if you think I should go with my idea. I said dog leashes only half-jokingly; I have no idea how to properly shop for a project like this / what these items are actually called.

I can even construct something that extends all the way over the shower if you sell me on an idea. There is another 18 inches to the left, in the provided pic.

I can provide exact measurements and additional pics if useful.

Thank you for reading! Really looking forward to this, appreciate ANY advice or random tips, no matter how small! I promise updates and cute pics!!

Stuck Toilet Flapper??,93,45,"My toilet flusher bar recently broke and needed to be replaced. I took out the old plastic bar and replaced it with a new metal bar (along with a new handle- just the basic kit from Lowes) but now the flapper/seal seems to be sticking up every time I flush.

Cleaning sewer smell,2,12,"Hi guys, 
Hopefully Ill be able to explain my issue enough. 

The floor drain in my basement is the first sign of when my sanitary sewer line needs to be snaked. Ive gotten good on seeing when it needs to be done before it breaches the surface of the basement floor. My issue is, for a while after it happens, the drain smells really bad.

UK - New house - Advice Requested,2,4," Evenin' all,

Just about to buy our first house, and there's a few initial things I want to do, especially in the extension.

I've added some photos below but the extension is wooden and according to surveyor a bit more like a glorified shed than an actual extension (still a few more days before I get the full report through). I want to pull off the t&g boards, insulate it and then plasterboard etc to make it into an office/playroom

Is that possible? Or is it just a waste of time and I should just stick with it for a couple of years until I can afford to rip it down and build a new one? Or is it diy-able? I'm reasonably decent at doing bits and pieces, especially with the help of Google & Youtube to fill in the blanks

Cheers!

What can I put behind my freestanding deck?,0,2,"We have a freestanding deck, but it's torn up and we are going to replace it. The only issue is it obstructs about a foot of vinyl siding for 12 feet or so along the back of the house. We want to replace the siding at some point in the future and if we build another deck we'll have to tear it down to get at it. 

I know I can attach the deck to the house, but I was hoping to avoid that for a bunch of reasons including that we don't currently have any kind of step leading out to the deck and we'd have to have one with the flashing. 

So other than attaching the deck to the house what can I do. Is there any kind of siding or board I could put behind the deck to stop the vinyl siding run  before it goes being the deck? Basically making it look like the deck is attached without attaching it?"

Durable, needs to last a few years with transport
Needs to look like a tank!

New office chair: how to care and maintain so it lasts as long as possible?,0,20,"Hi all.  I just purchased a new desk chair ([photos](https://imgur.com/a/V0pGki2)).  What can I do to ensure this lasts as long as possible?  Specifically

* How can I keep the material in the best shape I can?  The material isn't leather.  On purchase, I was told it is PVC plastic.
* How can I ensure the casters continue to roll smoothly?
* How can I ensure the chair remains as sturdy as it is now?

My previous chair literally fell apart because I did not care for it at all:

* The arm rest became loose then broke off
* The chair tilted onto one leg then that leg eventually snapped off
* The casters eventually began to stop rolling, the chair began to slide (instead of roll), and the plastic on the casters began to shred away.

This chair will get a fair amount of use.  I'll sit in ~6 days a week, for ~8-10 hours each day.

The chair was purchased new, but without any instructions/documentation (I live in Thailand).   

Thanks in advance."

Chair in apartment bedroom uneven due to warped and sunken floor. How should I deal with this?,1,14,"[Here](https://i.imgur.com/iT0a71q.png) is a very rough diagram of the situation. Basically, the floor in this room of an old apartment is severely warped, with several sunken areas and a differential of probably close to two inches from the lowest to highest points of my desk/chair area. Unfortunately, this is the best spot in the room for my desk. I doubt my landlord would do anything about it, and even if he was willing to call in a professional, it would be a huge pain for me. I would probably have to move all of my furniture out for awhile, as the room is on an overhang of the building and would likely require a lot of annoying work for the professional to come and fix. It's honestly slightly worrying in a long term structural integrity sense, but hopefully there won't be any issues during the course of my lease.

For the desk itself, I somehow managed to get it level with a combination of furniture pads for height and furniture leveling shims for the angles, but the chair obviously remains tilted. From one end of my plastic chair mat to the other, there is probably at least half an inch of sinkage total. This is rather uncomfortable, as the front left of where the chair is resting is a sunken area, and causes the chair to roll a bit and tilt in that direction. I considered making, or rather getting a carpenter or someone else to make, a plywood platform with furniture levelers for the entire desk area, but it would have to be pretty heavy duty to support everything and I'm not sure if it would be worth the cost and the effort of moving everything. It would also take up a lot of space very awkwardly in this small room.

My next consideration is applying the same tactic I used on the desk (furniture pads and leveling shims) to the bottom of the chair mat to get things somewhat level, and stuffing something underneath it to fill the gaps and make it relatively stable. Would this be a good idea? If so, what would be a good material to stuff underneath the mat. If not, what would be a good alternative solution? Any input would be appreciated.

EDIT: Several people have suggested putting a sturdy piece of plywood or other type of board under the chair. This is fine but I still have my concern of the board snapping or bending without any padding filling the gaps. Is there something I could use to fill in the empty space between the board leveled with shims and the floor?"
Needing advice on repairing an old dryer or buying a new one.,1,16,"I currently own a Kenmore dryer (model 86980800) but the heating stopped working in it. The dryer is easily 20+ maybe even 30+ years old now. 

My wife and myself already ordered a new dryer from Lowes(unsure of the brand of it) for like 420ish$. Now that I am investigating the problem more I feel like I could at least attempt to fix it(I think the heating element went out on it, but I will find out for sure in the morning).

What I am trying to determine is am I getting something better by getting a new one? Is there been a lot of improvements to dryer quality in the last 20-30 years? Or would replacing it get me the same quality(read speed of heating) as a new dryer without the 400$ price tag?

Fot reference my old dryer takes 70 minutes for a full.load of clothing but when my dad got a new one it went from similar time frame to like 30 minutes. And if replacing the heating element gets me that? I see no need for a new one."

Looking for ideas - Attaching wooden wall to steel beams,1,5,"Hello friends.  
When I bought my house, it has previously has some basement repair done, and has steel beams vertically supporting a wall that had previous water damage.  I've got no concerns over the structure/integrity of the support, everything was done by qualified folks.  Example of what I'm talking about, borrowed from internets:   [https://everdrycolumbus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steel-beams-for-bowing-basement-walls-forever-foundation-repair-wall-support-i.jpg](https://everdrycolumbus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/steel-beams-for-bowing-basement-walls-forever-foundation-repair-wall-support-i.jpg) 

I'm not trying to use this corner to build a little shelving, set up a small gym, etc.  Nothing fancy, but I'm trying to find a way to that I can attach framing or a wall to these beams.  In a perfect world, I don't want to drill into the beams to introduce moisture, and I'd like to avoid drilling into the cement since this is a know wet area in the past.

The only idea that i really had was to create some sort of triangle at the base and attach the top to the floor joists, so it can't really move, but this really adds a lot of construction, and if anyone had an good ideas to simply and solidly attach some vertical members right to the steel beams, I'm all ears!

Help needed on leveling a non-level poured basement floor (basement finishing),7,25,"Hello all,



I have spent the last 2.5 years renovating my home from 1910 and the last part of the project is the basement. Good news is I have NO water penetration issues at all AND the basement has poured concrete with 4 floor drains. Bad news, the floor is uneven.



The problem is the poured concrete floor is sloped towards each of the 4 floor drains. Fantastic that someone did this but makes it impossible to have a flat floor to do a finished basement with a fake wood or tile floor. I am searching for ideas on how anyone would level this floor, it's about 800 square feet and the highest point and lowest point (where the drains are) is a gentle slope difference of 2.5-3 inches. I am not worried about water ingress down here as I have owned the house a long time, it is on a hill and I have a french drain system around the outside.

Potential solutions:

I have thought about having additional concrete poured to smooth out the dips towards the drains, I have also through about doing a floating 2X4 pressure treated floating subfloor essentially making pseudo beams that rest on the concrete and then placing a MDF floor on it and then my flooring of choice on top. I would lose 3-4 inches of height if I did it this way, thankfully the basement is fairly tall.



Any other ideas?



Here are some photos of the basement.

2 questions if I may.

1 - Will one of these provide enough power to actual shake the rig?

2 - I know the amps are 50W per side. If 50W isn't enough to to vibrate one body shaker, could I connect both left and right outputs on to one body shaker, thus sending it 100W?

Thanks."

[DIY Request] - Adding between drywall and brick?,2,3,"Hey all,

Searched the sub and couldnt find a good comparison. 

Just recently moved into a condo. Realized the guy next to me might have the loudest snore Ive ever heard. To the point where I cant sleep at some points. 

Good news is I was already planning on adding 1/2 thick brick veneer to the wall. But I was contemplating if there was more I can add between the current drywall and future brick veneer. 

I was throwing around the idea of maybe some insulation foam (like R11?) and possibly another layer or dry wall or just concrete board? What are your thoughts or experiences? Thanks!"

Can I use my regular ground-sand as the sand in my concrete for a driveway extension?,2,3,"I want to add about 20sq ft to my driveway to better-accommodate a parking-angle, at any rate I usually use our sugar-sand 'soil' (I'm by-the-beach in tampa-area FL) with portland #2 to make mortar and it works great, however I'm unsure if this is something to mess with when doing a driveway extension!

Would love to save the $ of not buying pre-mix (ie just buying portland & rocks, and using my sugar-sand as the sharp-sand-aggregatte) but don't wanna risk a failed project, will buy sakrete 5000 if it's the smartest move but figured it was worth asking as a driveway extension is nothing like bonsai-pots (my main masonry endeavor, though I have done structural projects that came out great, just assuredly over-reinforced ie not cost-effective!)

Also is rebar over-kill?  The driveway is a 4"" slab, I'm planning to do a 6"" thick edge in the forms I'll make for this so the slab gets thicker towards the end (so cars can go right-up-to the edge w/o worry) but am uncertain if it's overkill to use rebar anywhere, or metal-mesh 'rebar sheeting' anywhere?

Under the tile is a mortar sheet which is also wet and is apparently glued to a wood substrate which makes up the ""step"" into the shower. I can tell that the wood underneath is also damp, I have fans on it now to air it out.

I'm tempted to tile and mortar over the wood but im worried the thinset i have would not adhere properly to the wood as a substrate, any thoughts on what I can use to tile onto the wood in a wet application?"

How to attached large joists to a notched ledger board over windows?,3,9,"Hello!

I am in the process of replacing a very shottily built deck on my house (I am in the US). The old deck was held together by way too few and way too short of hardware--as well as virtually no treated lumber. Most of it rotted away when tearing it apart or the (non galvinized) hardware rusted and sheared in half. I am shocked it supported the weight of the snow over the last winter after purchasing the house.

I planned on making the new deck larger (20' wide x 18' from the house), and thus went with much larger lumber. The old deck was using a 6' ledger board and 6' joists (roughly 13 ft from the house and 15 ft long). The new deck I am moving to 2x12 ledger board and joists, 16'' center with a 4x12x24' beam bolted to four notched 6x6 posts for outer support  w/ a small overhang.

My question is--the new ledger board overlaps two basement windows (split level house) as show in [this picture](https://i.imgur.com/7sPYrpb.jpg). How would I go about attaching my joists to these areas? Best I can tell, I'll have at least 2-3 of these joists over each window and I'll have 6-8'' of meat to attach to. Here are my options as I've seen them so far. Please let me know if I'm missing something or if I'm even in the ballpark.

- I put two 12'' joists on each side of the windows 6''-8'' off center with bridge blocking to strengthen up those areas and run notched joists over the windows.

- I notch my 12'' joists to the size of the available ledger board and use smaller joist hangers (im concerned about a corner load on this option)

- I cut a 45 degree angle into a 12'' joist and notch only the part sitting in the joist hanger to minimize the corner load.

- I hang smaller 6''-8'' joists in these shorter areas (this would also be an issue since they other end would not be sitting on the beam at the same height as the 12'' joists.

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I cant find much info online with installing a deck with windows in the way, and there's nothing in the 2015 intl. residential code (that my city uses) that answers this question. My neighbor thinks I am overthinking it since I'm using 12'' joists everywhere else on the deck, but I am not as confident. Also I am aware the bottom ledger board hardware isnt installed yet--I didn't take into considering that I'd be going into my foundation wall. Thank you!


Edit: The windows are 44 1/2'' long."

How can I level my concrete basement floor?,7,6,"I'm not at home right now, so I can't post pictures of the floor. I have been told to just add concrete where necessary to get it level, but I have low ceilings and I don't want to lose height by filling everything up. I was thinking about getting a concrete grinding wheel for an angle grinder and going to town. Of course, that would produce a lot of dust so I'd wear a respirator and have one of those high powered vaccums along side me.

The corners where the wall meets the floor are round and I think the only way to get those to be 90 degree angles are to grind them away.

The end goal is to make the concrete floor level so I can tile it.

Sorry if this is confusing. I haven't done any home improvement in the past. I will post pictures when I get home from work."

LF Instruction on how to float vanity cabinet,1,4,"Dear reader,

My dad had multiple floating bathroom cabinets (vanity tables?) made custom by order. Sadly he never came around installing them, so I'm taking on this task. The only thing I am unsure of is how he envisioned to 'float' the cabinets. I would appreciate if someone could tell me how I can do that best. 

See this album for pictures of the situation:
http://imgur.com/a/3bDH3Sc

To me the backpanel seems to thin to hang the whole cabinet on. So my instinct tells me that I should bolt some wooden bars on the sides, effectively creating an elevated level and placing the cabinet on top of these bars. I'm afraid that will be visible though.

Can anyone give me any instruction on how to float this cabinet properly? Thank you very much for taking time to read and instruct me!"

Total DIY novice here. New radiator will be wider than the distance between the pipes from current towel heater. Is there a way to extend the existing pipes coming through the floor to the correct position rather than ripping up my laminate flooring?,2,8,"I'm a complete novice here. DIY hasn't been something I've ever really done but my house is freezing in the winter and is currently full of single panel radiators so I'm upgrading to double panels (type 22's) which should help.

I've made sure to buy radiators that are the same width as the current ones so I shouldn't need to do anything to the current piping. The coldest room in my house by far is the bathroom and there's only a towel heater in there right now. Looking at other towel heaters, the BTUs are nowhere near close to what a similar sized radiator could offer so this absolutely needs replaced.

The problem is that the pipes on the towel heater go directly in to the bottom of it, whereas a new radiator will need them to be further apart to go in to the sides where the inlets are.

So, from my novice perspective, I have two options and this is where i need clarification and help from you guys. I can either take up the laminate flooring and try to do it the normal way but I've no clue what I'm doing there and there's a risk of breaking the laminate flooring this way (which I can nowhere near afford to replace; I'm only able to get the radiators because there was a clearance sale on near me and I got about 75% off them).

My other option (and this is what I want to know if it's possible and if so, what I need) seems to be to just extend the current piping similar to in this professionally made artist's impression I had commissioned: 

https://i.imgur.com/tZbnpCt.png

My only lead is some vague mention of an elbow on some forum somewhere (one of these: https://www.screwfix.com/p/tectite-sprint-copper-push-fit-equal-90-elbow-15mm/6486g ??). I'm also worried that a setup like this would be more prone to leaks. Is this a legitemate concern or is it just as unlikely this way?

$5 One of a Kind Axe Restoration From Start To Finish,14,9,"I picked up this rusty axe for $5 at the local flea market. I wanted to create something a little abnormal in the axe-world, so I did a metal etching design, and then used a knife-like handle construction for the axe handle. The image descriptions have full breakdown of the process. I also have a time-lapse video on the entire creation. Video link below!

[Video](https://youtu.be/bwBfZgLJ3UI)

[The Before and After](https://i.redd.it/0gdtiz97dvm31.jpg)

[Step 1: I grinded the rusty axe head until all the rust was gone and I was left with a smooth surface. ](https://i.redd.it/a2c3oku84vm31.png)

[Step 2: I used an orbital sander from grits 60 up to 220 to smooth out the axe. I then hand sanded up to 3000 Grit sandpaper for a polished finish. ](https://i.redd.it/ocn52iu84vm31.png)

[Step 3: I used a solid white vinyl sticker over the entire axe head. I then drew on a design and cut out parts to the design that I wanted to be etched into the axe. ](https://i.redd.it/fcjctcu84vm31.png)

[Step 4: The complete cut out of the design](https://i.redd.it/l1q8ogu84vm31.png)

[Step 5. I used a battery pack along with salt water and a cotton ball to etch the metal design. The electricity along with salt water created a reaction that eats away the steel. ](https://i.redd.it/14pouiu84vm31.png)

[Step 6: To create even more of an effect I used a rotary tool to further etch into the depressions of the design. I really wanted the design to be a focal point in this axe. ](https://i.redd.it/9lxwfnu84vm31.png)

[Step 7: Now on to the handle of the axe. I constructed the handle like a knife, with a full steel tang running throughout the entire handle. ](https://i.redd.it/apwexmu84vm31.png)

[Step 8: I used Walnut and Maple for the handle design. ](https://i.redd.it/6otugnu84vm31.png)

[Step 9: I cut out the handle shapes, placed the steel tang inside and epoxied the sides together. I then let to cure overnight. ](https://i.redd.it/eoioahu84vm31.png)

[Step 10: I shaped and sanded the handle smooth from 60-500 grit.](https://i.redd.it/7kt2jdu84vm31.png)

[Step 10: I used a tung oil and wax finishing paste to complete the handle. I love how it turned out. ](https://i.redd.it/myt5ecu84vm31.png)

Ill just preface by saying Im renting, so I cant drill new holes into the window frame or have a flap installed into the glass. The problem: I have a cat run outside my bedroom window that is basically netting attached to the porch awning and balustrade (ie - not standalone) . The only way for my cats to access the run is via the open window....which was fine until my golden retriever discovered that not only could he jump out of the window, but he could also chew through the netting - this has resulted in a few prison breaks and hes very proud of himself  As you can see in the picture - the window in question is a hardwood-framed single casement window. I need a physical barrier that prevents my budding Houdini from practicing his agility skills whilst still allowing the cats to come and go as they please. Ive noticed there are some existing holes at the top of the frame (circled in red) from when there were previously hinges for an awning-style fly screen- I was thinking I might be able to use those to support/mount something? Itll either need to be rigged in a way that doesnt prevent the existing window closing, or itll need to be easy to remove in case I need to close the window during bad weather etc. Ive got some pine and meranti planks of various sizes lying around so it would be ideal to use some of those, but Im not opposed to buying all-new supplies."

Suggestions re pimping motorcycle with loud sound for annual local pilgrimage,0,7,"A local annual pilgrimage takes place in which loads of bicycles come together to do bike ride together. It's common for bicycle owners to go creative and come up with funky air-horns and any sort of audible device.

Below is just  a setup I've done for couple of times, basically it has to last throughout the event which is approx 3-4 hours.

https://imgur.com/jdNOd0K

Apart from weight, which to be fair was never an issue, there's the heat and power supply concerns, 12v compressor sucks up energy like a b\*$#, and even worse is that everything heats up pretty quick, sometimes it has to be left for durations of half-an hour to actually start working again after cooling down. Eventually it stopped during the last use, only to find out that the brushes warmed up so much that they softened the plastic housing through which they slide to contact the armature and got stuck instead of  springing as intended.

Apart from bicycles, on the same event, there's a second group following along which consists of motorcycles, which is were my question lies. Basically thought of doing some sort of setup, to the motorcycle this time. Bike's a Honda CRF250L 2014 model, am looking for suggestions for the below:

\- what would be louder/smarter: Air horns setup with 12V compressor/s or speaker setup with car head-unit, not sure about  small multichannel amplifier - either way I have to keep in mind heat concerns as everything will heat up no matter what, so thermal cut-offs will ruin the plan.

\- As a power source, would you suggest an external/extra car battery mounted on the bike and power is sourced through it directly, also would you plug power from the bike's stator to the battery as to charge it, or would you do without the extra battery and source everything through the bike's power source generation - would any use of the stator be too much for the bike's electric recharging system since it might be too much or the battery too big to recharge all along, so no matter what, I don't want to harm the bike in any way, this is just an annual event, yet adding some spark to it makes it a whole different thing :)

this is a link for the mounted kit on the bicycle :  [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12v-Duke-Of-Hazzard-Dixie-Land-Dixieland-Musical-Tune-Car-Van-Air-Horn-Kit-Set/163798194520?hash=item2623221958:g:jJcAAOSwg8xb1vqU](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/12v-Duke-Of-Hazzard-Dixie-Land-Dixieland-Musical-Tune-Car-Van-Air-Horn-Kit-Set/163798194520?hash=item2623221958:g:jJcAAOSwg8xb1vqU)

Floorboard repair in the cheap?,1,7,"Long story short I have worn a divot in my floorboard. I do not want to pay to get it professionally repaired and honestly don't care to replace the carpet.

"Paver patio question, working over multiple weekends, do I compact after each section?",12,10,"I'm laying down pavers, as shown.  I only took deliver of about half of the materials and laid them yesterday.  I started with a temporary restraint on one side, and ended with this complete row.  The reason for that is I plan to continue further up towards the AC unit but will taper it, and don't know exactly how wide it'll be.  I plan to finish up next weekend.

1 - These pavers DO NOT allow us of a plate compactor for final bedding, so I called the manufacturer and they said use a 2x4 and a mallet.  I figure using roughly 2ft long piece of 2x4 and a 3lb deadblow hammer should be good.  Thoughts?

2 - Do I need to install a temporary edge on the working side, away from the AC unit?

3 - Do I need to tamp down what I have?

4 - Do I need to cover any of it, especially if not tamped?  I assume if it's tamped it'll be fine, I'm more worried for untamped condition.

5 - We are filling the zigzag edges with rocks.  There is a paver restraint lined up with the fence edge to help hold rocks.  Do you think this will hold up?  Last photo is what we're mimicking.

How do I fill holes after removing door frames?,5,2,"Hi DIYers,

not a native english speaker, sorry about grammar mistakes.

I recently bought a flat and removed the old door frames. Now Im left with holes in the floor/screed. They are approximately 5cm deep. I want to lay click vinyl on the floor and have to fill these holes first. New door frames will be mounted on top of the vinyl.
How do I fill the holes so that it stays somewhat flexible (between the holes are expansion joints which have to stay movable)?
How about sand, expanding foam, or any other material? Id rather not put screed inside because it becomes solid and the floor cannot expand anymore. And Im not very fond of the idea to cut more expansion joints into the floor.

Any idea will be welcome. Thank you very much and have a nice sunday wherever you are."

Question about grading around foundation,8,4," 

Hello all,

I posted this in r/landscaping as well, but I figure I might be able to get some input here as well, since I have been stressing about this. Thanks in advance for any info provided!: I purchased a home when there was still a lot of snow outside and didn't notice the following grading issue on one awkward part of the house. The following is a diagram of the area of my house:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/6n6ihpokyom31.png

The house has rock all around it. The green line represents the grass line, and the red question mark is the problem area. Grading around the other areas of the house is pretty straight forward (from what I've been reading, about an inch per foot, or some say 6 inches every 10 feet). However, this area presents a problem, because it is much further away from the yard, and the roof there is sloped on one side, so sometimes water flows off the side into this area, adding to the rain falling straight down

I've been reading online that you should maintain a 6-8'''' clearance between soil and the bottom of the siding to prevent moisture problems as well as prevent termites and mice, however, if I obey that rule, grading from the corner to the yard would result in essentially a ditch, a 3-4'' discrepancy between the work area and the yard line. I am pretty sure that corner, as it is, is below the grade of my yard currently as well, without removing the rock to fully analyze.

Looking at the grade on the rest of the yard, it looks like its not possible to obey both grading rules above. I initially thought of adding a drain there to drain water into another part of the yard, but I run into the issue again where, because that area is equal grade or lower to the yard, I cannot slope a pipe down to drain, and then run off into the yard swale, it would be far underground at that point.

I am kind of at a loss at this point. According to my calculations, I would need to stack soil about an inch or maybe an inch and a half from the bottom of the siding in order to achieve a decent grade, regardless of whether or not I install a drain there. Is that fine, as long as the water runs off correctly and doesn't gather there?

For additional info: I have vinyl siding, and right behind the siding is a white Styrofoam like material that sits on top of the foundation."

Tool Choices,5,6,"I just purchased my first home with my fiancee, and I decided I would get back into doing my own work. I had been an apartment dweller for 12 years, and have not had to fix anything since it was always covered. Now, I am responsible. I recently got a heck of a deal on Kobalt 24V brushless power tools at my local lowes, getting 4 batteries, 2 chargers, a circular saw, a reciprocating saw, an orbital sander, impact drill, drill/driver, leaf blower, weed eater, LED light, and multi-tool for under 600 bucks. My question is, in the future if I decide to get other tools, Kobalt doesnt have the strong lineup such as DeWalt, Ryobi, Craftsman, etc. and their 100+ tool lineups. Would it be worth investing into 2 systems to ensure I have all the tools I need, or would it be better waiting for new pieces to be added to the Kobalt brand. I have no problem mixing and matching, as the new house has plenty of garage space for me to store my tools, but since I have been out of the DIY game for 12 years, perhaps there is something you guys could tell me about which route to go. I just couldnt pass up such a great deal on a power tool set.

&#x200B;

If you do recommend investing into a second system, which one, and if you could, why.

Thank you for your time in reading all this.

Electric Winch Install for Home Climbing Wall,6,1,"Hi Y'all,

Not really a DIY-guy, so apologies if dumb questions:

I have a 12ft x 8ft wall I'm looking to chain up in my garage. It already has two sturdy eye bolts on the sides, where it can be chained up to the wall, and adjusted for overhang. I'd like to make the raising and lowering of the overhang easier than manually adjusting the chains, so I had in mind installing an electric winch up on the wall of the garage, and hooking up the top of the wall to it.

The wall, with holds, probably weighs about \~450-500lbs. My garage doesn't have any exposed beams, making bolting a winch to the wall challenging without cutting through drywall. Do you think screwing a plank of wood, crossing and attached to multiple studs on the wall, and subsequently screwing the winch plate into this would provide enough support for the weight of the climbing wall? I don't intend to climb on the wall with the winch - I'd hook the chains up to support the load of the wall and the climber. Similarly, do you think pad eye plates screwed into the studs would support the two chains/weight of the wall?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks a bunch."

Using PT 4x4 for deck handrail. How to keep from warping/splitting?,4,9,"Redoing the deck on our house.  Spent the big money to get composite deckboards.

Anchors for porch posts,3,12,"I want to replace the wood posts holding up a back porch. The posts today just rest directly on a slab of concrete in the yard and they aren't really anchored at all.

The holes for the bolts will need to be about 3 inches from the edge of the slab.

* **Epoxy**: Seems to be the best, but has a very long cure time during which I'd need to have the porch roof on the temporary supports. I'd rather not do that if I don't have to because I'd worry about the safety.
* **Wedge**: The ones I can find are zinc plated and don't seem to be recommended for outdoor use. Also, the hole is pretty close to the edge.
* **Screw**: Maybe the best overall?

I'm also worried about the slab's thickness: I suspect it's only about 5 or 6 inches thick at best.

How do I finish (i.e. drywall and trim) a garage that has a concrete curb at the base of the wall?,5,17,"**Setup**

We're getting a pad poured right away, and have the option of including a 6"" curb - something [like this](https://i2.wp.com/www.dirtwright.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Concrete-garage-slab-with-curb-1.jpg?ssl=1). The final use of the building will be gym/sports bar, but it will be built as a detached garage.

*Without* a curb, the framing will go down to the floor. This makes drywall and baseboards and whatever else super easy, with just screws and brad nails like normal.

*With* a curb, we get added weather protection (Alberta and snow), but then the aforementioned ease of installing drywall and baseboards is lost for those bottom 6 inches.

*I understand that this might seem like a trivial problem for a garage, but keep in mind it isn't a garage or a shop; there is no vehicle/street access. It is 100% a luxury, and so the final finish is as important as anything else. We're doing drywall, baseboards, flooring - the whole nine yards.*

**Question(s)**

If we DO have a curb, what do we do about drywall and baseboards? Can the drywall be directly against the concrete curb, with some poly in between? The concrete will have 2"" or 4"" insulation underneath and around the external sides, but I'm not sure if that is sufficient insulation to have the drywall directly in contact. Plus, how would we attach the bottom of the drywall to the curb/poly and the baseboards to the drywall? Adhesives are our only option?

**Caveats**

We want the walls to be flat from floor to ceiling, so no [ledges](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/4e/40/ff4e408b05f45173d9964a17f04de8f3.jpg) or steps, and we really do not want to sacrifice the area of our expensive pad with a [furring wall](https://img-aws.ehowcdn.com/350x235p/photos.demandstudios.com/getty/article/103/133/87613340_XS.jpg).

**Thanks!**

Thanks for any insight. As of right now, the *no curb* option is the most attractive, because it saves some $$ on the flatwork and makes finishing a lot friendlier (seemingly...)."

Need help with shelving.,1,13,"Hi all,

I need some help with what do to for some shelving. 

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/bvQ4WrX.jpg) is a picture of the area.

We would like to put built-ins on either side of the fireplace, with a counter and cabinets for storage below them. So far, no problem.

However, my wife would really like floating shelves, rather than see brackets hanging down. The space on either side of the outcropping is 55 inches, which seems like it might be too long for floating shelves and will result in sagging.

Our thought was to create a sort of frame with 2x10s screwed to the studs on the three sides, with the shelf tops screwed to the top of that. Each frame and shelf would be butted up against the next for the built-in look.

Is this a good plan? Will I be able to prevent sagging in the middle of the shelves? Other thoughts?

Thanks!"

Why do UK houses use plaster exactly?,16,19,"I'm from the UK and I don't get it. Having lived in a number of places and decorated it seems plaster is just a pain in the ass.
Only one place I've ever lived had perfect plaster. All the other places it was weak and crumbly so you could put a rawlplug in or you had to put in a lot of filler before painting.
Some places had this abomination called ""lining paper"" which is supposed to smooth out problem walls but just hides them a bit and ends up peeling at the edges after a few coats of paint.

Plastering costs like a few hundred  per room and some plasterers won't even do a job unless it's a whole house.

I've been told *plasterboard* (drywall) was invented to be a replacement for plaster and on YouTube I see Americans just painting over it fine. Over here we put plaster board (drywall) on then plaster over it, then paint it.
I don't get it. Plasterboard / drywall is a perfectly flat surface, why do we plaster over here?
I could imagine being able to replace a section of plasterboard easily, but a plastered wall I'd have to learn how to do it."

I am building a keezer out of a chest freezer for a friend. The collar is built out of pine laminated with solid cherry. The top is eight cherry boards glued together.

TL;DR is the title

I've run into a situation where I might need to regularly transport my riding mower. I have an escape that can handle the towing weight of a light duty trailer but I'm looking at possible trailers to purchase.

For storage considerations I really like the idea of the 1700lb harbor freight 4'x8' folding trailer. It folds up pretty small and because it is 4'x8'' I can also (infrequently) use it for things like drywall. My only concern is actually getting the mower on it. If I were to lift the tongue so that the back end of the trailer were touching the ground, could I just drive the mower up the back end of the trailer? Is there any reason to consider this usage a problem?"

Fireplace Reno Questions,1,1,"[https://imgur.com/a/LikDIKy](https://imgur.com/a/LikDIKy)

&#x200B;

Planning a fireplace surround renovation. Wanting tile and a new mantle and columns etc... But gotta get to that point first.

So first thing, previous owners of this house ""renovated"" and some walls they simply installed new drywall onto the old plaster walls instead of doing a full demo. So things that are original, like this fireplace, don't extends out as far into the space as they did originally since there is an additional layer of wall.

So the decorative stone of the fireplace only extends into the room about one inch. I expect it would be best to demo the stone and get down to the brick of the fireplace, place some cement board and tile off of that, but then it will be sunk into the wall unless I build it out somehow.

The stone used for the face feels sturdy and I'm wondering if I could apply cement boards to that and tile on top of it.

And if I can do that, how do I deal with stones that aren't flush to the rest? Most look pretty flat but then there are some odd ones that definitely aren't flat and will cause some issue. So how would I get the cement board to lay flat on the stone?

And lastly, the hearth into the living room needs to be expanded a bit. But it's also taller than the floor by a good six inches. Any advice on building a frame for this part?

I've done lots of research into how to do a fireplace reno but nothing has come up that mirrors my current issues.  I live in New Jersey.  I know the hearth must be expanded for building code.

Thanks all"

Need Advice on Redoing Lawn (Central Florida),4,10,"Morning guys, I need help.

&#x200B;

Live in Central Florida & I need some ideas on how to make my lawn more presentable.

I'm usually not home very much and my family doesn't really know how to care for a lawn. My sprinkler system hasn't worked since I got the house also. My HOA has been on me forever about fixing my lawn & I've tried before, but it didn't last. I'm looking for low maintenance options and something frugal if possible, while still looking good.

A couple years back I stripped my entire lawn and laid down three pallets of sod. Used hose sprinklers to water it twice daily. But I believe I overdid it with routinely adding fertilizer, insecticide, and fungicide every 3 months. It died within a year. My new bright idea was to buy rolls of turf and have an artificial lawn with sections of rock and different bushes. I'm not sure whether my HOA allows turf though.

Any and all ideas and advice are appreciated.

Can weeping tile sit ON TOP of the footer or does it have to go BESIDE the footing?,1,5,"See [the diagram here.](https://imgur.com/9wzhYKo)

Working on the exterior of a basement wall that has bowed in badly.  Don't know for sure why it bowed in, perhaps ice and water pressure (which is common to the area), tree roots, traffic, or some combination of factors.

Anyway the wall has been hand excavated down to the footing, which was a bear of a task.  Don't actually know how far out the footing extends to since the trench isn't wide enough to fully expose the footer.

The plan is to straighten and brace the wall, but in the meantime I want to do some prevention and add a weeping tile/drain pipe to at least improve the water situation, if that is indeed a cause.

I really don't want to do any more excavating.  Can I install a weeping tile drain on *top* of the footing?  Most diagrams I've seen indicate it *beside* the footing, but I'm not even sure how wide or how jagged this footing might be.  Due to various issues I really don't want to widen the trench unless it's critical to do so.

I've seen some diagrams referencing a ""foundation drain"" that seems to sit on top of the footing.

The frost line ranges 4 to 7 feet, and the footing would be close to that.

My instinct is to put the drain on top of the footing, surrounded by gravel, and that it will be at least some improvement over the current situation.  The idea is it would hold some excess water and at least reduce hydrodynamic stress on the wall."

I bought my house over two years ago from two guys who decided to team-up and buy, flip, and resell this place.  The problem is that they got no permits and had no oversight on the repairs/renos they did.  I admit that we should have checked to see if permits were taken out during the renos. The only problem we cannot find a solution for is that they did not install the vapour barrier under the wooden sills in the basement that they finished.  All of the walls are finished with drywall, but no vapour barrier underneath.

So my question is how do we install plastic vapour barriers under a sill that is already installed?  Is there another solution that I'm not aware of? Preferably something that doesn't involve us gutting the basement

Stucco (hard coat) damage,2,2,"So we had a stucco guy come out to give an estimate to fix lots of hairline cracks, few moisture bulges on cinder block, and woodpecker holes. He recommended filling the cracks and repairing the other damage. Then he would put a new coat on the whole house to make everything look even, he mentioned that the final coat will include Krack Shield technology to prevent further cracks from appearing. Does anyone know anything about Krack Shield? Is it a gimmick? Does it work? How is it applied-do they use mesh?

Should they put mesh (prevent cracking) on the old coat all over the house prior to putting a new coat?

\- This is how i ended up with a giant plane sheet mirror with nothing to hook it up with.

Dry laid limestone raised garden beds,3,0,"So, I have gotten into gardening this summer, and I enjoy it so much, Ive acquired some beautiful limestone I wanted to make dry-laid raised garden beds out of them.

I want to make sure it will be structurally strong enough to withstand the weather, (I live in TX, zone 9b).  I have pavers, can I sink them as a base and put the limestone on top, so I dont have to sink the lime stone? Would it help if I sank a paver vertically, in front of the limestone, for extra strength to hold the base in place? What if theres spaces, will that leak out too much water?  I know the joints should be as flat as possible, so theyll be stronger that way.

[Help] Stained Base Board Refinishing - Guidance Needed,2,2,"Hello all,
I am very new to  wood working and would like some guidance on best resources to learn how to best touch up/refinish my base boards.  As part of the project to have my wood floors refinished, I removed my base boards so that the contractors could access all of the wood floor boards and thought to take the opportunity to also refinish these boards.  The boards themselves seemed to have lost a bit of vibrancy and the original stain and topcoat were applied on the boards when they were first nailed onto the wall, not separately.  As a result residue from this process accumulated on the bottom edge of these boards and there are areas where no stain was applied (these areas generally don't see the light of day, but it annoys me none-the-less).

The original plan to refinish these boards was to sand down the layer of topcoat and a bit into the stained wood, then re-stain and topcoat the sanded boards.  Below are pictures of this process (different boards at different stages).  I apologize for the lighting glare on the boards.

Original Board:

In general the board above came out decent looking, but some other boards came out more uneven and blotchy.  I was recommended using a board conditioner before applying stain and have yet to try that.  I wanted to get some second opinions on the direction in case there is a better way to go about this.

Am I approaching refinishing these boards correctly?  What resources would you recommend me using in order to better understand how to best refinished stained wood base boards?

Thank you in advance for your assistance!"

We have an air purifier in there, but as you might imagine, it still gets a little stinky. We recently had the roof redone, and I had them cut a small hole and install a roof vent above this room, thinking the first step in making the room smell less would be to have a place for the air to go. 

My question is, what now? Do I install a bathroom fan/light combo so whenever the light is flipped on it's actively blowing exhaust outside? Can I replace the current fixture (florescent lights) with a fan/light combo without re-wiring things? Or is a simpler fix to install a passive vent and let the laws of ventilation do their magic? Will passive venting work regardless of external conditions or will we sometimes get outside air coming in?

FWIW, I'm going to be adding paneling to the walls and ceiling of the room as I address this issue, if that makes any difference. Currently the 'ceiling' is just roof joists with insulation taped in between. 

TL;DR: install a fan or a passive vent? How does airflow work?!"

Drainage Pipe Questions: Perforated French drain or solid pipe with spill basin?,17,7,"I live in TN, and this year thus far we have had a ton of rain. It has made the drainage in my backyard along my fence (about 100 feet) a nightmare. About 4 feet out along my fence is completely soggy. I originally thought of doing just a perforated 6 inch French drain, inside some rock and fabric. However, with all the rain, behind my tree at the corner of the fence there is some standing water. 

Multiple people I have talked to have said install a catch/spill basin in that corner and connect it to pipe and carry it out. One guy said use solid pipe (no holes) that way as it catches the water in the corner, it will carry it out and no additional water can be deposited in the soil, so eventually it can dry out. Another one has said to do the catch basin, but still connect it to perforated pipe (like the classic French drain). He says as the water is flowing, it will flow too quickly through the pipe and won't be able to deposit any additional water to the soil, and the holes will additionally capture any extra water from the soil. First guy (solid pipe guy) said he has done this on a property he owns and it solved the problem, but that his soil was never as soggy as mine is.

So what is the best way to go about this? Do I need to use solid pipe connected to the catch basin? Or go the classic French drain route (with perforations/holes, surrounded by rock, surrounded by fabric) connected to the catch basin? Note that the pipe will be underground about 100 feet or so and will connect/empty into my neighbor's ditch that they dug for drainage. My yard does has a slight grade over half of it. Both guys have said they will dig a grade into the ditch. Note that there may be an underground stream/spring somewhere (this seems to be a new development).

Do I need solid pipe or perforated pipe for this? I want to carry rain through the catch basin while it is actively raining. But I also want to help my yard dry out."

First DIY project - $600 bathroom refresh,241,59,"[Link to pictures!](https://imgur.com/gallery/FTT0ZoY)

After 2 years of homeownership I decided to tackle my first project which was to refresh the bathroom.
I dont want to call it a renovation because that sounds too major, but it was a little more involved than just redecorating.

I didnt want to get in over my head (I have no DIY experience) and I also didnt want to break the bank. So I had a budget of $750 but was hoping to keep it under $500. I ended up spending about $600. 

Here are a breakdown of some of the costs:
New vanity top - $250
New light fixture -$75
New faucet -$68
Mirror - $55
Paint -$35
Random tools/supplies from Home Depot - ~ $100
Towel bar and shower rod -$40

I was able to sell the old mirror I had to recoup a little of the cost.

This took me just over a week of working on it on and off after work. I wish I had more before pictures, but I think I took it up a few notches while sticking to a budget and getting some DIY confidence. Before anyone comments that I should paint the cabinet white, Im considering it but this matches the cabinets in my kitchen. Im still on the fence about whether I want to jump on the white cabinet trend.

Hopefully I can inspire another total DIY noob to try something out! Ive already learned a lot and Im starting to think about what to do next."

DIY powerbridge solution,3,29,"Folks - I am finishing my basement. As part of this I would like to run led lights strips in a crown molding. This will need to plug into an outlet. Instead of putting a physical real outlet at the ceiling location I am exploring a powerbridge solution. There is a commercially available solution as follows: https://www.powerbridgesolution.com/product/projector-single-outlet-power-cable-extension-kit

I looked into it and when you break it apart it is an outlet, Romex cable and an inlet that plugs into a standard wall outlet. So I am going the DiY route. I installed the blue electrical boxes circled in blue in the picture below and ran a Romex between them. I will then use the top one as an outlet and bottom one as an inlet which will plug into the regular outlet circled in red. Is this against code? The Romex will run within the wall. The commercial powerbridge solution link I posted above says it is up to code. so why should my DIY be different?

Reparing drywall with missing paper above shower - need help on the order of steps,9,15,"The latex paint on the walls above this shower pictured below started peeling.

I scraped the paint off, but much of the paper from the drywall also came off.

I would like to have the finished project be painted and have a bead of caulk between the shower and the drywall to prevent moisture from causing the peeling later down the line.

1. I have cleaned the area and applied a coat of RomanRx-35 PRO-999 Interior Drywall Repair and Sealer Primer.  
2. I plan on applying a 2nd coat of pro-999.
3. Next I will apply and sand Sheetrock brand All-Purpose Pre-Mixed Joint Compound.
4. Then I will prime with KILZ Premium Interior/Exterior Multi-purpose Water-based Wall and Ceiling Primer.
5. Then I will paint with a satin latex paint
6. Then I will apply Kwik Seal Kitchen and Bath Adhesive Caulk around the top of the shower where it meets the wall.

Where I am doubting myself is on the order of steps 3 through 6 above.  Is this the best order or would another method be preferable? 

Thank you in advance!

"Help: Will a drywall anchor 7/16"" from a toggle bolt in the drywall make both weaker?",2,6,"I'm hanging support brackets for wall shelves. The studs don't line up, so I'm hanging from the drywall. 

Each bracket has two holes 3/4"" apart for screws. My plan is to use a toggle bolt in one and an expanding drywall anchor in the other, [like this](https://imgur.com/a/CCLo8p6). The toggle bolt should be the strongest against force pulling out from the wall, and the drywall anchor should help with both outward and downward pressure. There's a third hole at the bottom of the bracket that will also have a drywall anchor.

My concern is that drilling a 3/8"" hole to get the toggle bolt behind the drywall so close to a 1/4"" hole for the anchor will only leave a 7/16"" bit of drywall between them. That drywall will split if it can't withstand the outward pressure of the anchor pushing into the mostly empty hole of the toggle bolt. If that happens, it seems like the toggle bolt will be more likely to break out.

Am I better off just using a toggle bolt without the anchor next to it?"
Electrical Dilemma...,1,19,"Hello all. Relatively new here, I hope this is the right spot for this question. 

Couple days ago with central vac running, the vacuum just cut out. Upon resetting the breaker which was what we assumed, nothing on the circuit works. 

On the same circuit are two light fixtures, three wall outlets. These are connected to a 15A breaker that is part of a quad-type breaker. All four 15A breakers on the quad are independent - none of them are linked. None of them trip either (will stay on)

Diagnosis so far:

1) With the breakers on I'm getting \~118V in the outlets that don't want to power anything. 

2) Amperage reads low on the wire at breaker (using clamp-multimeter)

3) I switched the wire to an empty 15A \[not on the same quad-type, but a different set\] - No change. 

4) When a night-light is plugged in to the outlets, it turns on but significantly less bright. 

Does the quad type breaker need to be replaced altogether? Could this be a different problem altogether? Any and all help much appreciated :)"

How to Redo a Formica Countertop?,10,18,"Edit: Thanks everybody for the great answers. I've got a good idea of what I need to do now. 

I have no idea what sub to put this in, so please direct me to another one if you think it would be better suited.

I have a vintage mid-century medical cabinet with a formica top. The top is all scratched, so I wanted to replace or cover it with a similar-looking formica to restore it.

The problem is, I cannot find anything online that explains how to do this. Everything is all about how to paint formica counters or replace formica tops entirely with modern counter tops, but I can't figure out how to replace or cover formica with formica. I just need to work with this thin layer.

Can I just glue it on top? What adhesive should I use that will adhere to a slick formica top? Is there a way to get the old formica off without creating an uneven mess I'll have to sand for weeks to get smooth? If I just put it on top of the existing formica, do I *need* to sand first (I'd rather not do this because I'm worried about exposing asbestos)? Can I cut the new sheets to fit, or will they be all jagged? How do I get a smooth edge?

Can anybody help me? Thanks so much in advance."

HELP: How can I repair a concrete step where the ground has washed-out underneath? (Link to album in description),2,16,"[Here are some photos](https://imgur.com/a/awOnhdA)

As you can see, the concrete step is in fine condition; no cracks, no sagging. But, the ground under it has completely washed out, and there is nothing supporting it. It's cantilevered out like a diving board.

I'm sure it is reinforced, and it looks like there is angled rebar supporting it on the house foundation side.

What can I do to repair this? Is the only fix to cut it out and re-pour a new step? Looking for effective, but the least complicated and least expensive.

Thanks!"

[Question / Advice] Self Leveling Underlayment Corner,3,5,"So this is a bit of a long story but I'll try to keep it short. After crunching numbers and time investment, I decided that pouring self leveling underlayment during my kitchen renovation would be better (for me) than tearing up the existing peel and stick from the 70s, the sub floor and leveling it the ""proper"" way. The house is really old, and potentially sealing off any asbestos was part of the motivation to go this route. We screwed up our first pour by going with a crappy product with bad instructions, and following them without second guessing (which is our fault) leading to wayyyyy too thick of a pour leading to mounding / hilly-ness. We tore it up and poured a different brand that suggest wayyy more water and we even used a touch more water than suggested. The floor leveled amazingly compared to the first time.

Through all that, I still screwed up and forgot to tear out the door frame / trim as we intended on making it an open walkway instead of a door. One corner ended up fine, the other got busted up during removal.

[Photos Here](https://imgur.com/a/SB2QX2D)

Any of you fine folks have an idea as to how I might best patch this? I have no intention of tearing up the leveler again lol. Thank you all for your time.

Addressable RGB LED Strip for my room,6,6,"Hi guys! I'm new to r/DIY and actually new to DIY projects. I've tried searching and I found a lot of info about addressable RGB LED lights, but I'm still very lost.

My main goal is to put an adressable RGB LED strip on the walls in my room (3.6m x 4.6m). I know I want it to be addressable, because I'd like to connect it to an Arduino (or a Raspberry?) and have more control over it. I'm not a programmer, but the software part I'm not afraid of. The hardware is what scares me. I found that I need to buy WS2812/B? lights. I'm reading though that I'll need a separate power for the lights and I don't know how to set that up. I believe my request is very straight-forward, but I don't know what to look for and what parts to buy. What I think would be an ideal setup is to have a long LED strip (16.4m) programmed by me with the additional extra of maybe switching between the programs with a remote? But I think that's diving deep now. Since I started mentioning extras, another extra I'd like, is some automation based on the ambient lighting/time or motion detection activation. But I'd be happy with just the LED strip + arduino part for starters.

Any advice for starting out is welcome! And apologies for my noobiness. I don't want you to spoon-feed me information, but I won't mind. :D

Shootin' Paint - How Much Compressor Is Enough?,6,15,"Hey guys, new to the Sub. I recently picked up a ['99 Montero](https://file.kelleybluebookimages.com/kbb/base/house/1999/1999-Mitsubishi-Montero-Side_MPMON991_505x375.jpg?interpolation=high-quality&downsize=391:*) that I'm working on a sort of budget overlanding build for. Just sank a bunch into preventative maintenance, and will be sinking a bunch more into wheels and tires, but now that funky clearcoat is buggin' the sheeyit outta me and I think it's time for some new clothes. 

I'd like to do it myself. After much deliberation and input from any friend who'll listen at this point, I settled on a [dark grey metallic single-stage acrylic urethane paint](https://tcpglobal.com/collections/acrylic-urethane-paint-gunmetal-grey-metallic/products/rsp-au2110-kit-m) for the body, and black [Raptor Liner](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CKE7B1E/ref=ox_sc_act_title_7?smid=A23ADOZFIJNPFB&psc=1).

From what I understand, the single stage/UA stuff is pretty nasty, so I'm getting a [full-face 3M respirator](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JZ1LG6/ref=ox_sc_act_title_8?smid=A1WMV09M24PZOP&psc=1) and tyvek suit (and booties!). 

I'm getting the infamous [$17 Harbor Freight spray gun](https://www.harborfreight.com/20-fl-oz-hvlp-gravity-feed-air-spray-gun-62300.html), and a [TCP Paint Mixing Essentials Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DP5D51I/ref=ox_sc_act_title_6?smid=A23ADOZFIJNPFB&psc=1) and various and sundry masking paper and tapes. 

But I'm stymied when it comes to the compressors. Some of the sites I've been reading say not to even bother with less than a 50 gallon compressor, which is $5-800. 

So my question is, bearing in mind the way I'm painting this (coat of single stage on the body panels, and raptor liner on the cladding), what's the minimum amount of compressor I can get away with? I need to be able to run it off a regular outlet, and afford the compressor, or rent one locally in LA. I found a 4HP 30 Gallon Devilbilss for $100. Wondering if that'll do what I need it to do. Also, if anybody can let me know if I'm missing anything that I'll kick myself for not picking up (like, does the spray gun in the Raptor Kit need a different paint cup), or common pitfalls or tips, please, please let me know . 

Thanks all VERY much in advance. Cross-posting this for as much expertise as I can gather. Thank you all!"

What is the best option for safely storing household chemicals?,7,8,"I've got some curious young kids, and some dumbass dogs. I'm worried about the paint thinner, butane, fertilizer, weed killer, etc that I have laying around the garage. 

Been considering a metal file cabinet (often cheap on Craigslist) for storing that stuff behind a lock and key. I can just put it on a high shelf, but my kids are talented climbers and know how to set up the ladder because I encourage them to help on Home improvement projects. 

The recommendations I see online are mostly for commercial settings, and I feel like a $5000 fire-proof cabinet is overkill. I am a bit worried about offgassing, leaking, and corrosion if I put these chemicals in an enclosed space not designed for the purpose. I'm no chemist, though. 

Where do you store your chemicals?"

[Help] Combining a rotisserie motor and lazy susan?,5,6,"Hey yall! Im trying to make a giant stuffed bear on a surfboard (long story) spin in a circle. So far Im thinking my best bet would be to combine a lazy susan and a rotisserie motor. I figured out the how, but my question is if the rotisserie motor has a load bearing of 25 pounds would the addition of the lazy susan help to increase the potential load bearing?? In my head it should but Ive also never done this before. 

If you have any other suggestions let me know for how to do this please feel free to throw out suggestions!! Im desperate :/

My best estimate is that the bear on the surfboard will be anywhere from 40-70 pounds and Im trying to make it spin at about 1-ish rpms in a circle with a 2.5 foot radius."

What cheap filling material can withstand varying from 20 to 220 C routinely?,2,13,"I'm doing a little chemistry project and I need to heat a metal can using a resistance. I installed the resistance on the bottom of the can, but I need some filling material to go around it and between it and the metal (otherwise I'd short the resistance).  


For now I'm trying plaster, but plaster seem like a bad idea. Heating it to 220 C will dehydrate it into anhydrous calcium sulfate. Just that will already make it crack, but even if I dehydrate it very slowly and manage to avoid cracks on the first heating, after cooling it will absorb water from air again, and then it will crack the next time I heat it (I can't always heat it so slowly).  


But I can't think of another material. I think cement would also crack.   


Do you have any ideas? Thanks!"

Light Magnetic Ball - Recommendation,3,6,"I was hoping for someone to provide some recommendations. I'm working on a project using some servos and magnets. I essentially want to suspend a 1 inch metal ball against a surface parallel with the wall then have servos move some magnets on the other side to move the ball so it looks like its floating.

I have high torque servos, but I would like to try to make it a cheaper project using small metal gear servos. I 3d modelled an arm that has bearings on the end to reduce friction from the magnets dragging the 3d printed parts.

I printed everything and programmed it and it works as it should. The issue is that the metal bearing (ball) I originally bought are too heavy for the servos to handle. I was hoping someone had a recommendation for a light or hollow metal ball that is magnetic. The only hollow metal balls I can find are 304 stainless steel.

I appreciate any suggestions."

I solved the problem by sort of making my own lathe.

I put the piece in a drill chuck, velcro'd the trigger to stay on maxed out, put the drill in a vice-clamp and took a hacksaw with a 32TPI and ran it until it made a groove. Once the grove was well established I moved the hacksaw left and right until it cut all the way through.

How to select a kit that will cover my needs? All these options are a little confusing,1,6,"Now for my background I have been working on home renovations with my father for years and as a result I am fairly handy on household work with the exception of heavy electrical. Whenever I needed to work on anything I'd just work on it in my dad's garage and of course use the tools he's collected over the years. He's just sort of had everything so I hadn't focused on specific sizes that come in handy the most. I'm able to afford a place of my own with a garage now and I've been thinking of fitting it with my own tools. 

My problem is all these very similar kits of varying number pieces of drill bits/wrench sets/etc make it really hard to select what I think I may need. I also don't have a specific project going on right now so that makes selection even more difficult. I feel like there's a lot of duplicates or speciality sizes when I see a 48pc drill bit set vs a 200pc drill bit set, hard to tell with the pictures and lack of individual sizes listed on the descriptions. Is there a general source of what ""every garage should have"" of sizes and tools to start off on? Or a few kits sold that someone could point me to? I'm thinking mainly wrenches (should I get a set of each type), drill bits (mainly drilling wood but sometimes concrete, plastic, metal, and drywall), hand held drivers, wire cutters/strippers, pliers, etc.

I have a few screw drivers of misc size so I may just buy a kit to cover my bases, I've got allen keys, I have a vice, I've got hammers down, basically I'm looking for things to cover any house hold projects (and light car work) that can be found in a few kits."

How I made a Metallic Epoxy Floor that looks like the OCEAN,0,8,"I made a floor that looks like the ocean in my friend's basement bar area: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFy\_tq5h83Q](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFy_tq5h83Q)

\- I etched the existing floor with a sharp floor buffer (There was already a solid brown old epoxy floor there). Next, I vacuumed the dust and blew off the floor. Then, I mopped the floor down w/ denatured alcohol.

\- I mixed the metallic pigment powder colors of Blue, Silver, and Sparkling White. I then poured it out and used a masonry squeegee to spread the epoxy and mix them.

\- I noticed that they were not covering well and you could still see the background, so I took a roller and tried swirling the epoxy in a circular motion... and this WORKED like a charm, completely covering the background existing brown.

\- Next, I sprayed the epoxy pattern with alcohol mixed with gold pigment powder and another bottle with black pigment powder and isopropyl alcohol. THIS is what gave the floor the ""caribbean""-""coral reef"" ocean look we were looking for.

\- I also rolled on a clear coat the next morning to protect the base colors.

I completely copied this idea from Leggari Products, who is very popular on YouTube, but mine turned out amazing for my friend's bar area.

I am entirely self taught from YouTube, and I must say, the process is EVEN EASIER than it looks. ANYBODY can do this stuff, I think most people get hung up on the prep work or not mixing the product correctly.

Is it impossible to install my clothes storage system?,1,8,"Hi all,

I am completely new to home renovation. I bought this [clothes storage system](https://www.wayfair.co.uk/storage-organisation/pdp/space-pro-relax-189cm-wide-clothes-storage-system-sppo1037.html) and hired a handyman to install it. We ran into 2 issues:

1.My wall is apparently super weak and not able to support the system securely, let alone one with clothes.

The instruction manual says that the system can be mounted onto brick, breeze block, concrete, stone, or wood as long as the appropriate wall plugs are used, which are not provided. The handyman used some wall plugs that he brought along, but later said that because the wall is so thin and weak that no wall plug is able to secure the load. (When he drilled into the wall, powders and wool came out.) He recommended that I get a wood plank to strengthen the wall before attaching the system. I have contacted the manufacturer of the system and they say they have never encountered such problem before, so they cannot give any advice on that.

2.My floor is carpet with underfloor heating and cannot be drilled.

I didn't know that the system needed to be drilled into the floor before I purchased it. I suppose it is to prevent it from moving which totally makes sense. 

Now, I have found alternative stanchions from the same manufacturer that is floor to ceiling instead of floor to wall and that works with other existing components of the system. It takes away the issue with the wall, but still leaves the second issue unsolved. I would imagine if the stanchions were installed tight enough, friction with the carpet would prevent movements, but there is obviously a risk.

So, these are my questions:

1. Is there any way to secure the system to a reasonably safe capacity without drilling the floor, and how?
2. If the floor issue can be solved, is it better to go with the wood plank solution or to buy the floor to ceiling stanchions instead?

Many, many thanks."

Question about insulating exterior wall with no sole or top plate,3,3,"The wife and I recently bought a house which was built in the 1880s that had an addition at some point in the mid 1900s.  Knob and tube, horse hair plaster, all the good stuff.  We've gut one of the rooms that we'll turn in to the master and are now putting it all back together again.  As part of this, we're insulating the exterior walls since they're open.  The building inspector was pretty clear about having a continuous vapor barrier on exterior walls (even though none of the rest of the house is insulated, but I get it).  However, due to the construction of the exterior walls, the studs run down to the first floor, with no sill plate and up to the attic with no top plate.  I've purchased and stuffed the holes with rock wool per the inspectors suggestion, but I'm left trying to figure out the best way to attach the vapor barrier at the top and bottom.  It feels a little pointless since the rest of the walls aren't insulated at all, but here we are.

I'm using faced fiberglass batts to create the vapor barrier but don't have anything to staple to the top or bottom of the batt to since the bay is just open at either end.

Gaps in foundation where footers meet wall,5,7,"My home was built in 78 and the back of the house is a daylight basement with the whole back wall above grade. Where the walls of the foundation meet the slab, on the exterior of the house, there are 2"" gaps. The trim covers them mostly but you can certainly get your fingers in there and feel up to the sill.

These gaps are typically filled with acorns so I know rodents are using them. In worried about pest infiltration. Can I cement them closed? My basement is bone dry and the property is on a hill draining away from the house.

Edit: I shared a link in the comment below with pictures. Hope that works as in not very Reddit savy."

[Heres my project](https://ibb.co/x1RZv8h)

Ive built/building a cupboard under my stairs and soon Ill be painting both the softwood frame and the MDF panels white to match the stairs. Im aware that I need to prime or undercoat (I dont know the difference) a few times before the final coat. My question is:

To save some money can I get away with buying one type of primer that will seal both woods and what would you recommend? I hear from some sites that you should avoid water based primer for mdf and others saying its fine so its a bit confusing!

Thanks, I'm UK based if that helps."
Need help setting up a baseball machine for my little brother.,6,1,"So, I'm off to college and my little brother is bummed out I'm not there to use our baseball machine with him.

I'm thinking of setting up an automatically feeder for him as a weekend project when I go home to visit in a few weeks.

Here's the pitching machine we have from SpinBall.  Essentially you put a ball into the ball feeder tube chute (red arrow) and the pitching machine spits the ball out with it's spinning wheels.

&#x200B;

[spinball pitching machine](https://i.redd.it/4tg0fxow7ql31.png)

Now, the automatic feeder essentially stores baseballs and releases one every 10 seconds or so into the pitching machine for you, eliminating the need to have someone feed the machine baseballs.

&#x200B;

Here is the automatic feeder my pitching machine company makes, but at $800, it's well outside my price range.

[Spinball Feeder](https://i.redd.it/6npf7fga8ql31.png)

&#x200B;

Here is a makeshift feeder someone made (not sure what they used as the motor, and not sure how it attaches to the machine).

&#x200B;

[Makeshift](https://i.redd.it/i683fprv8ql31.jpg)

&#x200B;

I was able to find two automatic feeders online from Heater Sports for only $60, which is certainly affordable and probably a better route than making my own feeder.

&#x200B;

[Heater Sports Automatic Feeders](https://i.redd.it/enetgceq9ql31.png)

&#x200B;

The two poles on the automatic feeder attaches to their two holes on their pitching machine, as shown below.

&#x200B;

[Heater Pitching Machine](https://i.redd.it/4gaen5y2aql31.png)

&#x200B;

But my pitching machine doesn't have two holes for their automatic feeder, so now the million dollar question is, **how do I attach their automatic feeder onto my pitching machine?**

&#x200B;

(1) My ball chute (where baseballs go in - red arrow on the first picture and the two images below) is actually removable.  It has a bracket it attaches to.  My preference is to some how use Heater Sports feeder and using nuts/bolts and attaching it to my bracket of my pitching machine then I can easily use flexible tubing to connect the feeder to my ball chute.  But the hard part is how do I get nuts and bolts to attach to the automatic feeder and my pitching machine?

(2)  Probably the easiest method would be to attach the automatic feeder directly to my ball chute.  It's made of hard plastic and should hold up the weight of the feeder and baseballs.  But I have no idea how I'd attach the automatic feeder to my ball chute.

(3)  Third method would be to some how get the automatic feeder on it's separate tripod stand (similar to what SpinBall's automatic feeder is) then I could easily use flexible tubing to connect it to my pitching machine.   Again, the part that needs figuring out is how to attach the automatic feeder onto a tripod.

&#x200B;

Have basic typical tools most households have (drill, screwdriver, wrench etc.), don't have access to or know how to weld.

"Slab in ""basement"" advice (I ripped up carpet)",3,7,"Hello DIY,

My wife is due in early November so I'm trying to finish all of my projects.

Unfortunately, the internet didn't give me the specific advice I was looking for.

I am in the process of redoing the downstairs of my split level house. It's not really a basement, but it is on a slab.

House was built in 1962 I think.

I am nearly done framing. Hope to get drywall up soon. Right now I am trying to figure out what to do with the floor. I ripped up the carpet because previous owners had a piss happy dog. 

The slab does not seem like it is super levelas I can feel where it rises up slightly as I walk on it barefoot.

This is what I know:
1. I do not want carpet.
2. I would be totally happy with the slab as it is, with a clear seal on it.

See my picture and read my questions:
http://imgur.com/a/PUwL2zI

1. What is the black stuff? Is it sealer? 

2. If I were to put down tile, I would need to level the floor a bit.. do I need to remove the black stuff before using self leveler?

3. If I remove it, are there any recommendations on how to strip it? (I bought some ZEP floor stripper from and did a small sample to see how easy it would be, and I did not have good results. Stripper not strong enough?)

4. If I'm gonna spend the time to remove it, can you give me a good enough reason to not just throw a clear seal over it and call it a day? (There is a coffee shop close to me that has this look and while I know it is for sure a fad, I like it, along with all the imperfections).

5. What would you do?

Thanks in advance."

Help: How do I run chain link fabric along this hill?,4,2,"I've already put in all of my posts. I didn't think about this hill well enough. 

So, I've seen online that some people put in terminal posts at the beginning of a hill and then use bias cuts and everything to make it even. My problem is that I've already put a line post there. I'm not digging it up. 

So my question is how to do this? Home Depot has some smaller (1-5/8"") tension bands that I could attach the line post and treat it like a terminal post (all the posts are pretty deep and have concrete, I think it could handle the pressure). That way I can reset the fabric at the beginning of the hill and use bias cuts.

Or, should I try to cut the fabric and join it together with another piece at an angle to fit the hill? This is theoretically easier as I don't have to run and get other supplies. But, I feel like this won't work well. 

Or something else? 

I've been googling all day and there is not a lot of info on chain link fences and uneven ground.

Paver Base Install Months In Advance,3,7,"Hello All,

The title is pretty straightforward but to add some clarity:

I am installing a patio in my backyard of my new home. My plan would be to outline, excavate, and install paver base this fall. I would follow-up with the paver sand and pavers in the spring. I would likely wait until the spring to compact the base as well. Im in Michigan for what its worth.

I know this probably isnt the most logical cadence but my motivation for this is two-fold - I am on a budget and couldnt afford to do the whole patio this year anyway, but paver base seems to be the lowest investment of the project, so easier to stretch it out. Secondly, the psychological part of it is we have several other projects going on and I seem to get frozen and get nothing accomplished. This way Ill feel like Ive tackled a huge part of the patio without having to invest too much.

Ive done some quick research on paver base install in advance and such, but only seem to come up with tutorials for on how to install to patios and nothing on the longevity of exposed paver base."

Arduino Triggering Relays Randomly,2,18,"Hi All,

Im working on a school project trying to make a standing desk, and I've run into some significant issues trying to get my Arduino working well with my relay board module (made for arduino).

Since the start of the project the relays have been temperamental, sometimes triggering themselves randomly with no trigger to do so from the code. A mock up of the layout and wiring can be seen [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/co5MkUOGwpY-copy-of-copy-of-standing-desk-button-control-system/editel?sharecode=m0HHWstkuZu2ijt8R2UcTqFOpNhH7zsCYRByFxbLAxQ=) (the rest of the code is for ultrasonic sensors to keep the desk level, but this issue has been occurring for ages, before any of that code was there).

&#x200B;

The system can go through periods of relative stability, but usually have one or two relays toggling randomly (no button press, nothing else even plugged into the Arduino other than power). They can also be provoked by touching the wires/plugging something else in (and then continue to toggle on and off after that). On/off duration can last anywhere from a fraction of a second to about 10 seconds.

&#x200B;

Why would the relays be triggering randomly and how do I fix it? Potentially a dodgy Arduino? Any help would be greatly appreciated, as its due next week and i'm becoming increasingly stressed.  Thanks in Advanced!

Looking for cellar advice with mould issues (UK),2,3,"Hey, We've a late 1800s end terrace with a cellar, when we moved in  (April this year) we got it tanked with membrane over walls and floor and plasterboard put up over the walls, and boarding on the floor. There's also an old victorian cold stone table, which didn't get covered and is still in contact with the outside wall. The steps down haven't been covered either. We then filled it with our extra stuff to be unpacked later.

After a few weeks we found significant dark patches of mould behind boxes and so scrubbed them with lots of anti-mould spray from B&Q. It was cold and 80% humidity, so to reduce this we've purchased a small dehumidifier rated for a room of that size and had it running pretty much continuously for 3 months. The humidity can get as low as 43% but if its off for a few days it rises up to 60-70% again.

Since the first mass clean of mould in April/May we saw a few patches develop but we haven't seen any mould in the past month or two but I'm a little worried about when it gets colder outside.

We've recently had radiators fitted to deal with the cold and they seem to be able to keep it at or above 21C, though they've only been needed the last 2 weeks. 

Do you think I should be concerned? 

If so, would covering the stone table/steps help, or using anti-mould paint on the walls?"

"Advice regarding shed renovation, please...",9,14,"OK, when I moved in here 9 years ago I acquired a garden so bought myself a little shed for storage and give myself a crafting space. Whilst most of it has held up well, the front and the roof has taken the brunt of the British weather, so before winter sets in I want to do a little renovation work. But I've not tackled a project like this before, and funds are limited, so before I go into this I'd like to pick your brains on this, please.
The pitched roof that was supplied is made of chipboard and it's not survived the rain, especially as the asphalt that covered it has shrunk somehow exposing it. I plan on replacing it with osb and replacing the rather lacklustre beam inside with something more substantial. Four rafters running down the length of the pitch, two at each end and a couple in the middle. I want to use birdmouth joints for this, something I've not tried before. I also want to increase the pitch of the roof slightly to aid run off in heavy weather. Can I do this by adjusting the birdmouth joints or do I need to adjust the height of the back and front wall of the shed? The front would be easy as that is being replaced anyway. If I only make the front taller though, it'll require adjusting the side walls and that's whole extra bucketful of work I hadn't planned on.
Also happy to take on any other advice you may have.
Thanks for reading and a preemptive thank you for your advice.

"Tried to clean mold off an interior granite wall, now it smells awful. Anything I can do to fix this? [Help Request]",12,25,"Hi,

[UK btw]

If this isn't the place for this then let me know and I'll delete it, I'm just somewhat desperate as my room/study in my house is somewhat uninhabitable now. 

I have a granite wall in my house which has a mold problem on the inside. It's a feature granite section that I believe goes all the way to the outside which has been pebble dashed. A mix of white and dark mold had grown across this wall and I attempted to clean it by painting on thick bleach, waiting 2 hours, then sponging off with water. The bleach did foam a lot (like really a lot) and I don't know how successful I was in taking it off. Since doing this I've ventilated heavily for 2 days and run fans and dehumidifiers overnight. The dehumidifier isn't picking up much water, so I can only assume that the air isn't damp.

The issue is there is a very strong mold/damp smell in the room now, which wasn't present before attempting to bleach the mold. Is there anything I can do here, or a product I can apply to kill the mold/block this smell?

I've only been living there for a year and a half so I'm not sure what the previous tenants did to the wall before I moved in, but another thought that occurred is that the granite might have been sealed or varnished in some way and my bleaching has removed this barrier allowing the damp wall smell to come into the room?

Any help or advice on solutions/products would be much appreciated!

Research online offers a million solutions to general mold issues from spraying vinegar to renting an industrial chemical fogger (I don't even know if I could get one where I am), but the mold is surely dead from the bleach so I'm not sure where the awful smell is coming from?

Thanks,

Rewan

**EDIT** for info the current plan seems to be to attack the granite wall with a dedicated anti-mold spray, then use a granite sealer to hopefully put a barrier between the room and any damp/mold. I'm researching appropriate products at the moment."

"Need advice, installing new kitchen back splash, new dry wall job okay?",2,8,"Yesterday I removed my old kitchen backsplash, at first I was hopeful and thought I would be able to keep the old drywall after removing the old tiles. Well that didn't work out, big holes, no big deal, I'll replace it.

Initially I was going to cut out the old dry wall flush with the top of the counter and with the bottom of the cupboards/cabinets. But after talking with my buddy, he said I needed to leave about 2"" of the old stuff so I could mud/tape to it. So that's what I did... but now I'm having second thoughts.

Should I start my drywall over? If I leave it as is then do I even need to mud/tape if I'm tiling over it? (I'd think so..) or am I fine continuing with the tape/mud idea..

"I'm refinishing a dining table, what should be applied to the wood top after sanding and staining?",8,4,"Hello r/DIY,

This weekend, I stripped, wiped down with mineral spirits, and sanded an old table that I will be taking with me to my first apartment. It's a light wood, I really don't know what kind, that had an unpleasant yellow hue that I have removed. I will be staining it darker to match the cabinets of the new apartment once I know the color of those. Then the legs and frame under it will be painted, undecided between a dark brown or pop of color (I will probably pick to contrast against the floor).

I have looked online trying to decide how to seal the wood. It's a dining table, thus I would like it to be durable against heat and water. There were several polyurethane options, and a few others mentioned. I wonder if you guys have recommendations? Brand suggestions welcome, too.

Additionally, Can I use the polyurethane or other options to protect the legs after I paint them? Is there a specific paint I should get for the legs?"

[The finished light after installation. Follow along to see the build.](https://i.redd.it/wh6r8gzycgl31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Before - This track light has been in the kitchen since the home was built in 1999.  It was time for a change!](https://i.redd.it/5k3eq0f3dgl31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[It started as this Douglas Fir 4x6 from Home Depot](https://i.redd.it/2lqa3mu5dgl31.jpg)

[First step, cut the 4x6 to length.  I cut it at 7'2\\"".](https://i.redd.it/ch80jtm7dgl31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[I wanted to mill out the interior of the beam for two reasons.  1\) Lighten it up 2\) provide a place for the wiring to go unseen  I used a table saw fit with two 10\\"" blades for a 1\/4\\"" kerf.](https://i.redd.it/mx01dx59dgl31.jpg)

Cutting a futon mattress,4,7,"Hi everbody,

I have a question concerning cutting a japanese style futon mattress.  I recently moved to an apartment, which is equipped with a nice loft bed.

Any ideas if this can be done, if it's good / bad idea, and why? Also, any suggestions about how to cut the filling would be appreciated. Probably it needs to be something stronger than scissors, maybe a saw?

No hot water since detaching radiator; still no hot water after reattaching radiator,9,7,"Hi all,

First-time house buyer here... I moved into my new flat three weeks ago and set about decorating straight away. I had perfect hot water supply from my boiler until I removed the radiator two weeks ago to strip wallpaper/paint behind it. I had no issues removing the radiator (I bled it first), but for reasons I don't understand it meant no hot water in the kitchen or bathroom. When I switched on the hot taps, water came out of the pipes that led to the radiator (which I thought I'd switched off the valves). No problem with cold water. I've been having bucket showers with water heated up in the kettle since.

Today I reattached the radiator - straightforward. However, no hot water still, anywhere - kitchen or bathroom. When I turn on hot taps, my boiler immediately fires up and I have no leaks.

I've had the taps running for well over an hour at this point, the boiler is working, but no hot water. The pipes don't feel hot either. I have no idea what the issue is. The radiator is a thermostatic one and I've played around with the settings on it. The only observation I have is that there is a pressure meter on the boiler that's reading 0 bar (I have no idea if it was reading higher when the hot water was active when I moved in because I didn't check - I'm guessing it should be higher?).

Any ideas what I could have done wrong? Pretty desperate for a proper shower at this point - I took a week's holiday to decorate the flat and resigned myself to being filthy. Back at work tomorrow though and a bucket shower may not cut it...

Any tips are greatly appreciated!

Edit for anyone who happens to stumble across this via Google: boilers need to be pressurised. When I bled the radiator, I took all the pressure out of the boiler system, so while my boiler was firing up when I turned on hot water taps, none of that water was getting into the pipes. Fixing it was as simple as finding out how to repressurise my particular model of boiler (a Worcester combi). It simply involved removing the bottom cover, locating the valve key (conveniently attached to the cover), and opening the mains valve to the boiler and keeping an eye on the pressure gauge to get it up to 1.5 bar. Once that was done, plenty of lovely hot water. Whole thing took five minutes, including watching the YouTube video! It took me longer to reattach the boiler cover..."

Hardwood floor refinishing question - can I use a handheld belt sander for a small area?,8,10,"I just bought a house - haven't taken possession yet - which has a small area of oak hardwood floor in the kitchen/dining room area. The hardwood seems to be in good condition but the finish is worn where the current/past owners had an area rug under the dining table, and the high traffic area near the patio door. The kitchen part has an island so the exposed floor is a narrow U-shaped aisle.

I am fairly experienced at hardwood floor sanding/finishing, having done the floors in an 1000 sq. ft. home a few years ago. I did a large living/dining room, hallway and three bedrooms using a big commercial drum sander and disk edger, and then applied varathane finish.

For this new house, the area is quite small and using a big drum sander and edger seems impractical. Is it silly to think of using just a handheld electric belt sander, with an oscillating tool for edges and corners, to do this job?"

"DIY 2.1 Stereo Tactile Transducer ""ButtKickers""",28,13,"Tactile Transducers, if you are unfamiliar, are basically subwoofers that shake the object they are attached to instead of moving air. When attached to furniture you replace the bass sound with a (near) silent vibration. I got a ButtKicker Gamer 2 late last year and while I love how I can feel explosions in movies or being shot at in games you always feel like you are in the middle of the action. I started wondering if there was a way to improve the immersion it offered. I wanted a better appreciation for off-screen explosions. I wanted to be able to react to games when I was *almost* being shot. 

What I was asking for was a stereo tactile experience. As far as I can tell, no one really makes this for consumers. So I went to a few stores and ended up building a 2.1 Tactile Transducer experience. You can watch my explanation and demo of it here: [https://youtu.be/8v\_42ygiVyw](https://youtu.be/8v_42ygiVyw)

The wiring is simple: audio jack -> splitter -> to two RCA cables -> two separate amps -> to speakerwire -> to transducers. On my PC I have a sound card that allows me to plug the two transducers into a shared left and right channel, and the ButtKicker into my sub channel. The video shows how I made it, but it doesn't really do the experience justice. Also, I built mine knowing I already have a ButtKicker gamer to use as the ""0.1"" channel, but had I not had one I could have left it out and the experience would still be quite immersive. Or, I could have used a 3rd transducer for the dedicated sub channel. 

I watched Die Hard With a Vengeance and the intro was simply amazing. When I play Call of Duty or Overwatch I now feel the direction to run. 

Oh, and I can turn off my subwoofer and use this to watch movies or play games *at any time of the day* because there is no bass in the house to bother anyone.

Weatherstripping on Doorstop,4,8,"Hi DIYers! My back door has been suffering from what I believe to be poor construction. The door itself doesn't actually make contact, or come very close to, the doorstop outside. As such, it's hard to seal the door with weatherstripping. On the hinge side the door appears to be compressing the weatherstripping adequately. However, on the handle side, the door is barely coming in contact with the weatherstripping so it's not creating a good seal. I used the vinyl covered foam bulb stripping, as can be seen in the linked images.

My question is how should I fix this? Should I use a larger bulbed weatherstripping? Should I replace the doorstop? If so, do I need to replace it on all sides of the door? I've never replaced a doorstop before so any guides or advice would be greatly appreciated!

Basement Insulation Questions,18,9,"Hi all! I live in NH and have some questions about basement insulation. Before we begin, here are a few photos of the basement: [https://imgur.com/a/xZxO780](https://imgur.com/a/xZxO780).

As some additional background: The cement walls of the basement start about 2-3 feet above grade. Behind the gray plywood door are the stairs to the cellar doors (which are the standard metal cellar doors). There's no insulation on the plywood...There's also no insulation between the basement and first floor. I do need to keep the basement above freezing because that's where all the water stuff is and there is a heating element stretching about a quarter of a long wall and a thermostat for the basement.

I'm looking for suggestions for best bang-for-my-buck for insulation. I am aware that NH has a program that will pay 1/2 the cost of any insulation upgrades done by a professional up to $4k, after a $100 inspection, but you need to have 12 months of utility bills (which I don't have, yet) and there are certain requirements for the amount you have to spend to heat during the winter (I'm not sure what those are, however). I'd rather not spend an excessive amount on heating this winter if there are a couple simple changes that I can make, especially ones where it will end up being far cheaper to DIY than hire a professional. 

So, there are a few areas that I was considering - 

1. Replace the plywood door with a normal, insulated steel door. I can't imagine that the plywood has any real R-value and a prehung steel door should be fairly easy to install. Not sure if this is worth the upgrade, so I figured that I'd ask,
2. Replace/fill the empty rim joist spaces insulation. It's currently fiberglass. I've heard that this is no longer recommended/not nearly as effecient as other methods. However, I'm not sure what method is best. I've heard both: (a) cut foam board to fit and spray foam the gaps around the edge, and (b) spray foam the rim joist. The only issue I have with pure spray foam is that I've had to replace a couple areas where there were doors, so I kinda want to keep those accessible if there are issues in the future. I've also heard that I have to get the foil-backed foam board if I want to go that route. Suggestions? The internet seems to have different opinions depending on the site. I'm also not sure how much better that will be than it is currently.
3. Begin the process of insulating the walls via rigid foam. I""m not sure on the best method on this or whether it's really worth it. I would imagine that it would be for the section above grade, at least, and I'd rather look at just doing the foam board rather than build a whole 2x4 wall, but I'm open to suggestions. 
4. Anything else I missed? If I'm insulating the walls, do I really need to be concerned about the spaces between the joists between the basement and the first floor?

I do currently seem to have quite a few spiders in the basement (yuck) and am hoping better sealing will eliminate that problem. My last place had a red-squirrel and mouse problem (yuck-est), so I'm not eager to introduce any elements which would be attractive for rodents/would not be easy to remove and replace if necessary. I haven't seen a squirrel or mouse here yet, thank god, but definitely want to keep in mind their love of fiberglass and the need to exterminate any which do make it into the house."

Light bulb help,6,12,"Hi
We bought a house about 5 years ago and a bulb in the basement just died, so I need to buy a replacement and I'm unsure what to get. When I removed the bulb the sticker on the fitting said max 75w r30, par30 and max 65w br30. The current 8 bulbs (4 on 2 switches) are par38 75w/120v halogen that I am struggling to find exact replacements for. 

So I thought I should go for led if I have to replace them all but when I bought 4 par38 led I couldn't get them to dim properly. These are par38 15w (100w equivalent).
I read that the problem might be the dimmer so I bought the recommended dimmer. With this switch I can set how dim I want the dimmest setting in the slide switch to be. The problem I am having is that when I set the level to actually be dimmed the lights won't turn on each time and to get them to turn on each time I have to set the dimness to a level that isn't actually dim.

I think I must be doing something wrong but I'm unsure what. If I can't get led bulbs of the right size to dim ill just buy a new set of halogen. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

How to bring Ethernet to a room across the hall in rented apartment?,14,18,"I moved into a new rental. The fiber optics outlet is in the middle of the living room right next to the Swisscom DSL+phone plug but I need Ethernet the most in the office across the hall. Wifi and powerline are not an option because they're too unreliable and only provide a couple hundred megabits at best.

I can't drill or alter the walls in any way because they're freshly painted and I'm not sure I'll be able to patch them up and find matching color paint. To complicate things, they painted over wallpaper I guess to give the paint some kind of texture. I'd rather avoid doing anything to the walls.

There are several panels in the ceiling which I assume are the points where electrical cables meet. I haven't opened these panels yet to look because they've been painted shut and I don't want to open them and damage the paint if not necessary.

In the room that shares a wall with the office, there is a plug labeled T+T which I assume is another Swisscom plug.

On the wall in the hallway there is a T+T panel which I'm guessing is ""Telegraph + Telephone"" and which I suppose is the point where the Swisscom cables come in from the outside.

I've thought of a few way I could bring ethernet to the room:

1. I could pull a 15 meters long fiber cable from the outlet to the office. That would involve going around and across 4 doorways. I might be able to tuck the fiber behind the baseboards (which are screwed on, conveniently, rather than nailed) but that still leaves me with several 90 degrees turns across the doorways which I don't think the fiber cable would take very well. I also has to make it across a door and I suspect opening and closing a door over the fiber will eventually break it.

2. I could somehow thread a fiber optics cable from the living room Swisscom socket to the bedroom Swisscom socket and then have the cable turn around the wall through a doorway to the office. Not a huge fan of this either because the cable would somehow have to make it across a door and I suspect the glass inside it might break from closing the door over it too much.

3. Fiber along the electrical lines. There is power in every room and maybe fishing the cable through these wall plates all the way to a power outlet in the office would do the trick? Not sure how safe that is though because I know cables can act as wicks when there is a fire and spread the fire quicker.

4. Because I'm using a media converter anyway, I could pass Ethernet cable around instead of a fiber optics cable. I want the router, firewall, etc to be in the office anyway so that could work. I don't think passing it along the electrical wires would be safe. But what about along the Swisscom lines?

Further questions I have are:

- What really are these ceiling panels, and that T+T panel?

- How hard or realistic is it to fish cables through existing conduits in the walls?

- If I can't fish cable through the walls, what do you use to attach the cable along the walls without damaging the walls or baseboards when you remove it?

- Is flat Ethernet cable better or should I stick with round cable, considering I'll have corners to turn? What I mean is there will be some turns that are 90 degrees along the same plane, but there also will be turns that are 90 degrees across two planes: these are not a problem with round cables, but they are with flat cable from what I can picture in my mind's eye.

The wall mounted ones are angled downward.  The building is trapezoid shaped.  Currently they're burning 100w incandescents I think.  Maybe even 125 watts.  They're big damn bulbs.

Suggestions for Repairing Old Basement Walls,9,3,"I recently purchased a 110 year old house with a limestone block foundation and I am looking to ""clean-up"" the basement as best I can. One way that I hope to do that is by repairing and patching the basement walls. It appears that the limestone block foundation was originally coated with a thick covering. It's much thicker than plaster and I believe the term is parging.


Over time the coating has cracked in places and even detached from the wall. Fortunately the majority of the coating is still present and seems to be very durable (i.e. not brittle). That means that I would ideally be able to repair the affected areas rather than replace the entire coating.


As I have not done this type of repair work before I am wondering what the best approach would be. In my own research I have come across numerous products ranging from Drylock to Quickrete. Has anyone worked with these types of old basements before? Pictures are linked below.

Stair Baluster Question!,8,9,"Hey DIY,

So something very frustrating happened today! My wife has had a dog the for the last four years recently he's being super difficult whenever we leave the house. We left him upstairs today and unfortunately came home to the balusters like this:

[https://i.imgur.com/igPzjU0.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/igPzjU0.jpg)

I was hoping to get some advice from you guys on the best way to fix this.

I'm guessing realistically we could just replace all the balusters at the top of the stairs, but then these would be different to the ones going up the stairs (I can't seem to find the same ones anywhere). So we'd have to replace all but this seems like a hugely expensive job - which means I've been trying to think of some other options.

Does anyone have any ideas on if these could be repaired? The teeth marks are too deep to just sand - maybe coat in some kind of wood filler, sand and refinish? I was hoping someone might be able to let me know if these are salvageable.

Sorry if this isn't the best place to put this. I've been a long time lurker in DIY and it was actually this subreddit that convinced me to do my own basement conversion. My first time making my own post here though!!"

Seized Jack Stud,13,6,"Hi Everyone, Im a first time homeowner. 

While moving in I hit the garage with the uhaul. The linked picture shows the jack stud at the entrance. The stud is almost a  half foot back from the mouth of the garage door on the bottom (the gray plywood in the picture). The other side is fine. The jack stud is stuck and the toe nails holding it in look very corroded and are in too tight a spot to get them out. Im hesitant to replace the stud as the garage door is attached to it. 

Any advice reddit?

Basement height varies from one end to the other,4,6,"New DIYer here- I am in the beginning stages of finishing my basement and about to frame the perimeter walls. The height from basement floor to bottom of the floor joists at one end is 81-1/4 but gradually increases to the end which is about 83-1/4 inches. 

My plan was the build the walls on the floor and tip them up into place. Would this still be my best bet and cut all my studs to 78-1/4 and shim the rest of the floor joists? 

Ive also been told I could put my bottom plate and top plate in and then cut each stud to length and put it in but that seems like way more work and much more difficult.

Tumble dryer not heating correctly.,6,20,"Hi folks,

I'm having an issue with my Hoover tumble dryer. It spins fine, and warms up slightly so I know the heater is working. However it doesn't get hot enough to dry the clothes. My wife religiously cleans all the filters, so there's no issues with those. 

I've checked all the temp sensors for resistance, and they work as they should (the resistance decreased as I warmed them up). 

I checked the pressure sensor for the reservoir pump, which also worked correctly (nothing on the meter until I blew into it, mimicking water pressure).

Now there is a small hole in the rear plastic cover (I believe the heat is channelled through this cover into the drum): is it likely that the hole allows enough heat to escape so that the drum doesn't get hot enough, so the heater tries to get hotter and trips the thermostat?"

Solutions for placing a patio table/chairs on an uneven rock surface?,6,10,"I recently purchased a new house that has a seriously badass patio area that I am really looking forward to using. However, the floor is made of roughly-set rocks mortared together. [Here is a picture.](https://i.imgur.com/cePveXK.jpg?1) Looks cool, but will probably be terrible to have a patio table and chairs on, because the chairs will get stuck on the rocks and will wobble because of the unevenness.

So, I am trying to figure out a way to (reasonably inexpensively) remedy this problem without pulling up the rock floor. For stationary furniture/grill I have no problem shimming the legs to get everything to sit level, but I know it will be a problem with the patio chairs. 

My first thought was to lay down a large rug, but I think that chairs will still kind of get caught when getting pushed around, and they certainly won't sit flat on all four legs without rocking. So the second thought was maybe to get a couple bags of sand to spread out underneath the rug to basically ""fill"" the topography of the underlying patio rocks in a way that won't permanently ruin the patio floor? But then I kind of figured that the sand would get washed away or would get pushed out from under the rug over time, and then I'd still have the same problem.

Any ideas are welcome!! Thank you very much."

Masking/stencil techniques for spray painting?,5,7,"Hi DIY!


I'm spray painting my bicycle. I'm going to do multiple layers of colors. I want to mask off some color layers in cat paw print shapes. I want all the paw prints to be exactly the same size and shape. If I use vinyl or masking tape, the paw prints won't be exactly the same. They may be close but the toe positioning will vary on each print at the very least.


The best way I've come up with is creating a stencil, laying the stencil on the frame, paint over the stencil with some sort of masking liquid or something, and repeat for each paw print using the same exact stencil. Then when I'm done painting colors I just clean off the masked prints and then I have paw prints.



**My question: what would the best method be for the stencil liquid? I've considered grease, tooth paste, and other such things.**"

We went the DIY route with our new countertops and are super happy about it.,23,7,"We are in the middle of a kitchen renovation right now, and although (eventually) we hope to go with granite or quartz countertops, we did not want to drop the ~$5000 for new countertops AFTER the contractor discount I would be getting because of my work.

Instead, after lots of research into cheaper options (which there are frustratingly few of), we decided to chance a go with epoxy countertops.

We debated on doing laminate, but I just hate the inorganic look of laminate, and the edge options are not my favorite. I very much dislike the 90, discolored edges of laminate. 

I've done concrete countertops before, which we loved, but the style didn't quite fit our new kitchen. We also have a lot of countertop space and concrete would be very cumbersome to attempt. Overall, it didn't fit our situation.

The pros:
-VERY inexpensive
-""Natural""ish looking (with some artistic talent)
-More natural, rounded edges
-Waterproof
-Heat proof
-Scratch resistant...can also be buffed out if needed
-not ""plastic"" feeling like most laminate
-more DIY friendly than concrete
-if you mess up, you can just buy some more epoxy and try again over it
-different finish options
-warmer feeling than stone

The cons:
-Pretty steep learning curve with making it look ""real""
-Messy when you're pouring the epoxy
-some woodworking skills and tools required
-edges aren't perfect and can easily be messed up
-still not real stone

The costs:
-$80 for epoxy
-$25 for colored powder/primer
-$25 for two sheets of partical board
-$10 for mixing buckets
-$10 wood glue
-some other small misc stuff I already had

First I made the base by measuring the shape I needed and cutting it out on the two sheets of partical board. I clamped the two sheets together and then glued it after it was cut, but I might have switched the two in hindsight. After it was all cut and the right size, I took a random orbital sander and gently rounded the corners and edges. Gotta protect little baby heads.

Next I covered our entire kitchen in plastic. Do not skip this step. The epoxy gets everywhere, as it needs to drop off the sides to cover the edges. I brought the base back inside, set it up on the plastic covered island, and got the epoxy ready.

I won't go into detail with mixing and pouring the epoxy, as Countertop Epoxy's website and YouTube channel goes into depth on everything. I will say that the thing that I learned (at least in our case and with the look we were going for) LESS COLOR IS MORE. We wanted mostly white counters, so the more color we added, the harder it was to get back to white if we used too much. We found that if there was an area we didn't like, we could take a paint roller and roll over the spot we didn't like and it would make it pretty much go away. You've got like an hour of working time before the stuff won't self level anymore. Another thing we learned is DO NOT SKIMP ON EPOXY. If the directions say you need a gallon of epoxy, use a gallon. If you go too thin, it will start drying and leave these ""fish eyes"" or divots in the surface.

Again, watch their videos online for more. After waiting a few days for it to cure and harden, I took 320 grit sandpaper and buffed the whole thing with a random orbital sander to give it a matte finish and take away the shiny, plastic look that epoxy can have if left alone. Some people like that look, but we don't. Honestly it makes it look like real stone when it's matte as opposed to shiny, anyway.

All in all, we're really happy with them. It's obviously not real stone, but for less than $200 we can always go with real stone after we save and want to drop the money. Honestly, though, I think it looks a lot like real marble. We spent a lot of time in stone warehouses and it definitely looks like some of the slabs we liked. It looks even better in person.

In I think the 2nd pic, you can see how they added a piece to the rough opening to be able to affix the hinges on the current door. I'd be able to attach this side, if it weren't for the fact that I want this door to be hinged opposite to the current one - for the reason that the hardware for the interior entry door is almost guaranteed to conflict with the hardware for the planned storm door. We rarely use the front door as we enter from the back where the garage is, so the inconvenience of having the 2 doors hinged opposite isn't an issue.

Edit - after looking at this another minute, I think i'm going to have to add a piece to the one side similar to the one that's already there where the current hinges are attached. I really don't want to do this, will require the door be smaller, and weaker. Am I not seeing this whole thing the right way?

TIA for any help and ideas"

Removing Tile Over Hydronic Radiant Heating,3,6,"Were in contract to buy a lovely house with hydronic radiant heat in the floors. The house was built in 98 and the hydronic system itself is in good shape, just covered with late 90s boring 8x 8 eggshell tile and pink carpets. 

Unfortunately, the tile is the dominant floor covering of the 1580sqft house. 

We could do laminant or another hard surface flooring over the existing tile, but that double thick layering may impact warmth throught the house. We thought of matching laminant to existing tile colors but that may only go so far in updating the interior design of the house. 

Has anyone pulled tile off over hydronic flooring before who can lend some advice?"

E27 socket with small outer diameter to replace E14,3,3," So I finally found a fitting lamp for my room, but the problem is that it has E14 sockets. Since I already have E27 lamps bought I thought it might be possible to fit a bigger socket instead of the old one, but all the E27 sockets I found have a bigger diameter than 45mm (about 1,8 inch). When looking into the sockets I noticed that they all have the actual thread in the middle, a little gap and the outer wall ([imugr.com/ISifPCJ](https://www.imugr.com/ISifPCJ)), so my question is if it would be possible to cut the outer wall and the little spacing brackets off in order to make it fit. If you find any E27 sockets that are smaller in the first place they would be good too. Adapters are not an option since they add too much height."

Help: How do I cut irregular shaped tiles?,0,16,"I have a 12""x12"" mosaic of small irregular tiles.  They're shaped like spin tops (the spinning thing from Inception).  I can't make a straight cut on a wet tile saw without having the cut go weird.  The piece either rattles or shifts just enough to bend the cut.

My tile saw doesn't have a sliding table, do people make Jigs for these weird shaped pieces? I need to cut it in half both length-wise and sideways for the wall edges and counter top edges. 

Do people make Jigs for these things?  Or should I be doing all this on a wet tile saw with a sliding table?

Thanks!

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback, everyone!  I ended up cutting a block of wood to make a JIG. I was worried that the wood would warp when wet, but it actually helps bend to the irregular tile shapes and every tile was slightly different."

Cross Section Finishing Advice?,2,5,"Hello all,

I'm attempting a somewhat last minute gift for my wife. I'm taking a ~1"" thick cross section of tree and turning it into a clock. My plan is to sand the rough cut smooth, burn numbers into the face, and install an analog clock mechanic.

As for finishing, I was looking at a pour-on (envirotex lite, unless there are better suggestions) in hopes to make things easy on myself and preserve the bark around the edges. Would I be able to use this, or similar, and just pour over the top and let it run over the sides of the piece? I enjoy woodworking but have never enjoyed the finishing phase. I am also concerned that any normal brush or wipe on product will soak into the grain unevenly.

 I'm working on this project when I can after work hours and I've only got a few days left so any advice would be immensely appreciated.

I apologize if this has been asked before. I've been searching through past posts but haven't seen what I'm looking for.

Thank you!"
Can I leave my granite threshold unglued?,2,3,"I am remodeling my bathroom, and had the countertop company cut a door threshold to match. When I put the threshold in its place, it's locked in. The threshold has to go directly on plywood subfloor to get an acceptable height to the floor tile, and I'm wondering, instead of thinsetting or gluing on plywood, could I just leave it free? I figure that would allow the subfloor to expand however the heck it wants without worrying about this thing cracking. Also  I don't have to worry about stress points or voids when stepping on the threshold. Any advice for this amateur would be helpful."

Question on pouring Concrete Counter Top Mix into a form.,4,11,"Hi,

Curious if anyone has experience with using the quickcrete counter top mix.  I'm doing an indoor outdoor counter top and instead of doing a melamine board form I had a buddy weld up essentially what is a steel pan that will hold the concrete and allow it to have a metal trim that will be the outside edge of the pan and also I figured going this route would make it extra strong since it may need to hold a heavy snow load occasionally.

My question is do I still need to add wire reinforcement inside the concrete to prevent it from cracking or would the strength of the pan be enough since it will have no flex due to using a heavy gauge steel?  Also what is best way to sand, polish and stain the concrete?  Thanks for any advice!"

The goal here is to get rid of the toxic oil smell, not to get the deck cosmetically clean. Tried washing it with Simple Green degreaser, that helped a bit. Then tried pressure washing with Simple Green deck cleaner, which also helped, some, but the problem persists. Ive got some Simple Green Crystal Industrial Cleaner/Degreaser on order, and Ill try that next.

Im using Simple Green products just because I dont know of anything else that is relatively non-toxic, Im open to suggestions.

PVC pipe -- brittle? will it survive this project?,8,30,"I am thinking of using PVC pipe to construct something unusual and am wondering if it is worth the cost (\~$100)? Four 8' pillars of 2 inch PVC connected at the top using three-way PVC elbows. Then plywood on top of that. Why? Because in winter we have some large chunks of ice that slide off the roof right over our rear entry door. So this would be to create a sort of protective overhead gizmo in case a chunk of ice (the size of a 50 lb sack of potatoes) came falling down, to hit the protection instead of my head or shoulder. Do you think the gizmo would survive multiple hits during the winter, or would the PVC shatter? This would be in temperatures of even down to -20F or even -30F. I don't want to pay $100 and my time constructing this if first time it shatters. The past winter we wore our bicycle helmets. But this winter coming up we have a new dog which likes to lie down right outside the door-- and it would be injured or killed by the falling ice blocks, yikes. So I am looking for a solution. The section of roof above the area has a rubber membrane / rubber roof, causing the ice to slide off from heat from the house (bungalow style house, so there is no attic to insulate to make the roofing cold)."

I removed ancient wall covering from my plaster bathroom walls. How should I proceed?,2,9,"My home was built in 1953. We are remodeling our bathroom. There was an aluminum chair rail over a strange cork wall covering that had been painted over 5+ times.

I decided to peel the wall covering off and skim coat the wall before painting. The covering came off pretty easily due to the glue being dried out but now I am left with the glue residue and a few small areas with cracking plaster. The lathe is not visible or anything but I am concerned that if I use any sort of abrasion to remove the glue it will further damage the plaster.

Any advice? Could I use Gardz or something and skim coat over the glue? What can I do to repair the crumbling plaster areas? Ive looked into this but Im finding a lot of conflicting information.

Question about replacing thermostats.,10,25,"Hi all,

We recently bought a house and wanted to change the thermostats out to Nest or similar ones. The ones we currently have are very basic and don't allow for pre-sets. We had a mass-save person come out to replace them as they have a free service for it. They looked at it and told us that we cannot use any other type of thermostat due to the wiring. Here's what it looks like behind the thermostat panel:

https://i.redd.it/xu5w6crp5ok31.jpg

I am trying to figure out:

1. What type of pre-set thermostat we might be able to use (Does anyone have or have had a thermostat similar to this one?)
2. Do we *need* to hire an electrician? Or is this something we can do ourselves?

&#x200B;

I tried to post this to the other threads, but couldn't figure out how to add a photo. If this should go there, please let me know!

&#x200B;

UPDATE: Hi everyone! I want to thank you all for your help. I came here thinking that it would be impossible to do this myself due to the conversation I had with the MASS-Save install person. Glad to see they were wrong. I'll post another update when I get this sorted, assuming I don't die from an electric shock :)"

Noodling through a large concrete planter DIY,1,13,"I've been working on my backyard and want to incorporate a couple large statement-piece planters. I'm thinking of planting trees in them, or large perennials. Purchasing planters as big as I'm envisioning (at least 2-3 feet tall) is going to cost quite a bit for each planter. And I'd like to make them out of concrete so I figured I could maybe DIY-it.

I've found several tutorials on how to do this online. For smaller concrete planters, [there are molds](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TWFF8SP/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_G8eCDb9M1GG6T). Sometimes people [construct molds out of cardboard](https://www.farmhouseonboone.com/farmhouse-on-boone/diy-concrete-planter/). For larger ones, you're usually stuck constructing wood templates to act as molds. I want to avoid doing this. With a little creativity, I was hoping to use the concepts behind the tutorials for using molds... but on a larger scale.

I want to take two plastic trash cans, one large and one slightly smaller. Add strips of wood across the top of the smaller can to hold it in suspension within the larger can. Grease the concrete-facing sides of both cans with veggie oil to help the concrete not stick (read this on a tutorial). Suspend the smaller one. And then pour in the quikrete and let it cure. (Please see my crude diagram below).

Does this seem feasible? Would I need to fill the smaller trash can with dirt or sand to help ensure it doesn't bow in? Do you think I'll be able to reuse the cans? Any ideas and thoughts would be appreciated!

I used a stud finder and detected metal at stud intervals (no electrical).  All the walls in my apartment did this, so I figured it's metal studs.  When drilled, the metal was kinda thin, with plaster or a similar textured insulation behind it, followed by more metal (1.5 in deep).  I stopped at the second metal barrier.

Can I replace the vent in my kitchen sink with a spout for filtered water?,484,187,"I just moved into new construction, and after we moved in, the plumber had to come out to fix something.  I asked him what the thing coming out of the countertop next to my kitchen sink was, and he explained that code required the plumbing under the sink to be vented.  He also said, many people remove the vent and replace it with a soap or filtered water dispenser so they don't need to put another hole in their countertop.  Our fridge doesn't have filtered water, so I was thinking I would do as he suggested.

Are there major problems I'll cause by removing that vent?  From the vent, a hose runes down to a spot just above the garbage disposal, so my thought was that I would just cap and seal it there.  Every other house I've ever lived in didn't have such a vent coming out of the counter, so I welcome thoughts if I'm missing why it is important.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the feedback/comments.  I attached a couple of pictures, but air gap for the dishwasher looks right based on what is under there.  You can see in the pictures at the link the grey hose coming from where the dishwasher is and the black hose running down from the air gap.  I probably misheard, or it was the realtor that referred to it as a vent.  Either way, some useful feedback here, and it sounds like I can remove it as long as I do it correctly.  My neighbor is a pretty handy dude, so I'll probably ask him for some help.  Pics: [https://imgur.com/gallery/skyibOB](https://imgur.com/gallery/skyibOB)"

How do I mount a roof ledger for a patio cover?,7,25,"I need to install a ledger board for mounting a patio cover.

I can't mount it below the eaves because the eaves are too low for the minimum height of the patio cover. (My house has low ceilings). I could cut the legs of the cover down to mount it directly below the eaves but it would make for a pretty low ceiling on the patio and would also void the warranty on the cover. I've seen people in forums recommend mounting it to the fascia board, but that doesn't seem strong enough. It's also maybe a moot point anyway because there is not enough space below the gutters. There was previously a pergola mounted in the same position that a previous owner installed. They just just nailed some 4x4s directly into the roof without any kind of flashing as mounts for the ledger. You will be shocked to learn that water leaked through the nail holes. 

I can't find photos of what I want to do other than this very expensive product that would have me make some pretty larges holes in my roof: [https://skylifthardware.com/](https://skylifthardware.com/)   The manufacturer said I would need four of these mounts.

"Is there any reason I shouldn't use MDF vs. sanded plywood for a painted, built-in closet?",4,21,"Hi r/DIY

a few months back I built an MDF built-in for my entry-way closet. I primed and painted it semi-gloss white, and I was very happy with the results.

Now I'd like to create a similar built-in for my much larger bedroom closet. the closet is 90 inches across and 84 inches tall, but I plan to build 4 separate units and join them together at install - the largest of which will be 25 inches across. 

Would MDF be my best bet for this application? I mainly want to use MDF because it's cost effective, but i've also worked with it before, know how to paint it, and it's very flat and square. The only downside I see is how heavy it is. Does it make sense for me to go with a 4x8 sanded birch or any other plywood for this project?

thanks for the advice, I will certainly share pictures of the build!"

Question about building a base for a Shed,3,16,"Hello all you DIY folks!  

  My wife and I recently bought one of those 8' x 12' Prefab sheds from a box store.  The place we are looking to put it is on a slight decline, so I was thinking about putting it on Piers (as opposed to setting it on gravel).  

  My question is in regards to how many piers to set.  My plan so far is to use 4x4 posts set below the frost line (42"" here in Michigan),  then string a 12' 4x6 across the piers. once thats in place, I plan on using Joist hangers to attach 2x6s level with the beams, then throw some 3/4"" plywood down for the base, and assemble the shed on top.

My question(s):

a)  does this plan make sense? The shed will hold our riding lawnmower and some miscellaneous gardening stuff (pots, hoses, tomato cages, etc.), so I figure the joist hangers would be appropriate (as opposed to putting the 2x6 on top of my beams).
b) assuming it does make sense, how many/ and how far spaced should the 4x4 posts be?  Can I Get away with 4 total in an 8' square and cantilever the beams to get to 12'?  Should I do 3 posts per side spaced at 5' with cantilevers?  3 posts spaced at 6'?  Should I do them every 4'?

Any help/advice would be appreciated!"

Tips/Help: Getting pyrite slate slips that WILL rust,205,16,"Google not being my friend on this - because most people want to STOP or REMOVE the rust from their slate...

[Example4](https://imgur.com/a/paxPWfx)

So what I'm trying to recreate, is what you get in Example 4

I'd like to start with blackish grey slate, knowing that it can get rust stains if exposed to water.

This would not be in a bathroom as per Example 4

I'd like to CONTROL the rust - basically paint it with coats water selectively. Ideally, then there be some way to 'seal' it, to prevent further rust over time?

Is this something that's doable? What specifically am I looking for in a slate tile that means it would rust when exposed to water and air (as many try to sell themselves as 'this won't rust')? What could I use to later seal it when I have the effect I'm after?

Some of the other examples (2), the slate is already rusted, or (3) doesn't rust. When it comes rusted, the overall effect is too mottled for my tastes

Appreciate any advice from someone who knows about the geology/chemistry needed here, and/or worked on something similar

We've all had those projects that started out planned with excitement, but over time become a running joke or constant reminder that you lack the resources, skills, or time needed to complete what once made you so passionate. I'm telling you, if I can finally complete the worst part of waking up on the weekend you can too. It really doesn't matter how long it takes. The feeling of completing a project after years of procrastination, lack of time, or even hard times is even more exhilarating than completing a project on time and under budget. You can finish it.

October, 2009. I purchased my first starter home in a new neighborhood under development while it was only studs. I came by every day after work to check out the progress, pick out colors, decide on tile, etc., but most importantly, plan landscaping which included my first shed on my own land. I had printed out plans for a [kit from Home Depot](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Handy-Home-Products-Phoenix-10-ft-x-8-ft-Solar-Shed-with-Floor-Kit-18160-3/100350467) that was half shed and half greenhouse, but unfortunately the 'glass' part was on the 8 foot side of a 8x10 floor kit where i wanted the 'glass' on the 10 foot side of a slab. The house was completed in December 2009 and i moved in. In the months leading up to moving day i had redesigned the home depot shed to suite my needs but retain the same set of building instructions and materials, just dimension changes for walls and trusses (and the addition of anchor bolts).

I had everything i needed to start construction on my dream shed come spring. ...then i met my wife in January. It wasn't her fault, my priorities changed. I did manage to pour the slab in May of 2010 with the help of my future wife as a date sort-of thing. Pouring the slab was the hardest i had ever worked (im a computer guy. i'm handy, but still a computer guy). I ordered a palette of cement bags, rebar, 2 yards of red sand for leveling, and timber for the forms. A friend of mine showed up to help set up the forms and happened to have a laser leveler and had the amazing idea to raise the form to the level of the foundation of my house. I HIGHLY recommend doing this. Every time i've gotten a little bit of flooding in the back yard i'm thankful he had that idea. I rented an electric mixer that fit 2 bags of cement at a time and started pouring.

For years afterwords i'd pull out the shed plans about once a month, make notations, check prices, make minor changes. The slab ended up becoming a pedestal for our picnic table for cookouts. I felt i didn't have the time, money, or skill set to complete the shed. Family just happens. Our resources were shifted to a wedding, to car repairs, to children. It just happens and years flew by.

People would ask about the slab, and i'd have to explain my idea for the shed, sometimes pulling out all my plans and notes to show them. Again the excitement! I knew i'd get to it eventually, but again, things happen and years flew by. Five years later: May 2015: I knew i had a work bonus coming up in June and, as an added bonus, the final house of our planned neighborhood was under construction. I had made friends with the contractor at this point and got the 'ok' to pick their scrap pile. I was able to build the walls and roof trusses to my modified design flat on the floor of my garage for just the cost of a pack of exterior screws. The plan was now to erect the skeleton of the shed and use the work bonus to complete it. That weekend i was able to erect the walls and trusses with the help of my neighbor. The next weekend i was able to add the plywood roof base and cement anchors. I picked a stack of 1x4's for the trim, but it would have to wait until i could purchase the shed paneling.

A week later i got my bonus and picked up a bunch of sheets of shed paneling, roofing fabric, shingles, and roofing tacks. I was able to mount the paneling, the trim, and the shingles that weekend. Also that weekend, the AC coil in my house broke. No more work bonus. The only thing i could afford the next weekend was 1 gallon of white exterior paint to try and protect the skeleton of the shed because i had no idea when i would be able to continue.

The shed just sat like that with just the trim painted and half exposed for another 4 years. Every time i'd get another bonus, or raise my savings, or get a tax return, or surprise payout from somewhere something bad WOULD happen the SAME weekend. I'm not exaggerating. I'd save up the funds to finish the shed and BOOM, car breaks down ...badly. Next time: my dog gets hit by a truck. Next time: wife trips over the three legged dog and breaks a front tooth in half. Next time: daughter totals the new car. (all of these happened, all at when i was planning to finish the shed, all of which cost thousands of dollars) It became a running joke in my family. ""Do you think our house would ever burn down?"" ""About the same time i'm ready to finish my shed..."" My wife and i were literally scared to receive a lump of money because it always ended badly.

Well i was able to eventually finish my shed. Here's how it happened. June 2019: My office got a new contract for a large installation and the customers were really demanding. They wanted all the work done in 30 days. I rode with the sales team (I being lead engineer) to meet with the new customer. On the 45 minute drive my boss asked about my shed. I explained everything that was going wrong whenever i was ready to finish it and how it haunted my dreams. He told me, ""If you can get this done on time, i'll give you a bonus to finish your shed."" Immediately i was petrified. ""You can't do that!"" i said. ""Something bad WILL HAPPEN!"" He changed his tactic to ""Alright, i'll buy everything you need to finish your shed if you can get this project done in 30 days."" Alright, that works. We shook on it.

July 2019: Work project done. I knew a LOT of the wood on the exposed side was rotten. Had the boss-man order me a lot of extra 2x4's to graft into good pieces and replace the rot. Along with this was all the pieces i needed to complete my shed. This included [sheet plexi](https://www.homedepot.com/p/LEXAN-Thermoclear-48-in-x-96-in-x-1-4-in-Clear-Multiwall-Polycarbonate-Sheet-PCTW4896-6MMCL/205202473), [foam strips](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Frost-King-E-O-1-1-4-in-x-7-16-in-x-10-ft-White-High-Density-Rubber-Foam-Weatherstrip-Tape-R516WH/100119011) for supporting the plexi off the wood roof trusses, [mounting bolts](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-Fastener-for-16mm-Thermoclear-Multiwall-Sheet-85190128/206935863), more 1x4 trim, paint, silicone calk, acrylic calk, wood filler, [plexi sheet connectors](https://www.homedepot.com/p/2-in-x-96-in-x-5-8-in-Thermoclear-Polycarbonate-Multi-Wall-H-Channel-PCTWH-16MM/205202545), flashing, drip edge, quarter round for window trim, more shed paneling, plywood (to build my own door), door hinges, latches, door handle, simple vent covers, and probably other stuff i can't remember right now. Completing this shed was always on my mind, and every month i'd go asses the weather damage and keep a running list in my head of what i would need to complete it. So when it was time to square up with my boss's offer i was ready. A week later a flat bed showed up at my house with more than everything i needed. I started by ripping away all the rotted wood and carefully grafting in good wood. I painted the finished grafts to seal them from the elements with high quality exterior paint and primer.

August 2019: I cut the 4'x8' plexi into 2' strips and used the connectors to assemble them into a 10'x7' sheet that slid directly into place with the seams centered on the roof trusses. i lay'd a bead of construction adhesive on the bottom inch of the sheet and bolted in the 3""x3"" drip edge at the bottom. i sealed the edge with silicone calk. With a left over strip of 2' wide plexi, i cut and mounted a window on the far side opposite the door and trimmed it with quarter round (sealing it with silicone calk). A storm was coming so i quickly had to mount the side flashing/drip edge and seal it before the rain. My shed was now covered!! The next weekend i fabricated a door. I cut the plywood to shape and covered it with wood paneling adhered with construction adhesive. i framed it with 1x4 trip and screwed it all together. I painted the trim for protection until i could get to the main paint. I mounted the door against 1""x1"" door jams that i nailed into place. i attached the door hardware. My shed was now totally sealed.

September 1st-3rd, 2019: Paint and vents. done.

Its still hard to believe it's finished. It took so much out of me for the past 9 years that i still wake up feeling like there's something i'm supposed to be planning, but for the first time i can walk out back in with my coffee and realize i don't have anything to do (as far as the shed is concerned). Sorry for the long post, i'm just extremely overcome with the feeling of accomplishment. We plan on starting plugs in the greenhouse this spring and transplanting them in our new garden. :)"

Vent Hood Support,3,17,"Hi All,

My wife and I are trying to install a vent hood over the rangetop in our kitchen. The vent hood insert we selected secures into a structure and not directly into the wall (Big mistake). As a result right now we have a support frame built with 2x4's but my wife is concerned with how far it is jetting out. Wondering if the DIY community has any suggestions on how we might be able to approach a thinner support structure so as to reduce how far the vent hood will come out from the wall. The hood secures with screws from the front and sides of the unit.

I've done quite a bit of research but can't see to find any simple suggestions other than the 2x4 construction so would appreciate any thoughts. We are installing a Zephyr Monsoon 1 insert. Thanks!

Is this the product I should be using or is there something better?

Need recommendation for hardware,2,6,"I am looking to make outdoor blinds to block wind and I could use some recommendations on hardware.  Since I don't know what I need is called I'm struggling to find it (if it even exists).

What I want to do is use sun shade fabric and attach rollers to each side every 6 inches or so.  These rollers would fit into a track on either side of the blinds that would keep them from moving in the wind.

I'm struggling to find the track and rollers.  I considered using t-channel (like what many 3d printers use) but I don't think it will slide well enough.  Whatever I use needs to be relatively element proof (though there will be a roof above it, but the sides will be exposed to any windblown rain, pine needles, etc.).  Something that utilizes ball bearing wheels in a track would be pretty ideal, though I'd need it to have some sort of base that I can sew to the fabric.

Can anyone recommend any products that would fit the bill for this?  I'd love any links that you think may work since it will give me a good starting point.

A note on the posting rules: I'm **not** necessarily looking for a specific place to purchase a product.  I'm trying to find out what product would work for this specific purpose.  I hope that this is within the rules.

Roof Mount an Antenna. Is it safe?,2,21,"I need a little guidance. 

Back story, I cut cable tv out of my life and have gone with a very small omni-directional air antenna. I had read that it is important that you don't mount the antenna until you've tested various locations on your roof to identify where you get the best signal strength and then mount the antenna.  

To date, since I move the antenna quite a bit, I made a plywood platform and mounted the antenna to that. I'm ready to permanently mount the antenna, but I'm worried about drilling into my roof. I have found plenty of videos explaining how to roof mount antennas, but just because you can do this, doesn't mean you should. 

I'm asking people wiser than I:

Should I roof mount the antenna, get a non-penetrating roof mount, mount to the fascia, or something I haven't thought of? Thank you."

Looking for thoughts re: a leaky A/C unit,1,9,"Hey everyone - I'll try to format this post well and keep it as brief as possible. Our A/C unit (located in the basement) has leaked before, causing the basement area to flood. I tried several things to fix it (flushing the system, cleaning, etc), and I thought I *finally* fixed it when I installed a U-Trap (I'm sure that's not the official term) last Summer; however, it leaked and flooded the area again recently. 

Here are some things that are worth pointing out:

Removing [this panel](https://imgur.com/a/nafA6tp) reveals the coils, etc. The unit does not leak when this panel is off - it only leaks when it is in place. When attempting to put the panel in place, the airflow really sucks it in.

[Here's where the unit is dripping.](https://gfycat.com/shorttermenchantingbilby) That's far less of a drip than we *were* experiencing; however, it's still concerning me. We had our fourth hvac technician visit today. No one could seem to figure out why the unit was dripping. Prior to the final visit, this drip was *much* worse whenever that panel was re-installed. In this particular gif, you can see it leaking just a bit. 

The last guy to pay us a visit kept saying ""something in your house *has* to have changed in order to cause this. Something with your air ducts."" Despite me telling him that we haven't had any work done, and haven't done anything to the house, he kept adamantly stating that ""something must have been done."" His explanation was that the airflow was too powerful, and that it's sucking water back inside from the drain pipe. When I asked him why that would have happened recently, he again said ""it's because something has to have changed in your house."" 

That technician did his best to solve the problem. He re-cleaned the system, cleaned the coils, flushed the pipes (as I had done), etc. He finally [opened this hole,](https://imgur.com/a/SJZT0IU) [inserted this piece of pvc pipe into the other hole,](https://imgur.com/a/IZSw9LF) and [opened up a back panel on the A/C unit](https://gfycat.com/snivelingdesertedantelopegroundsquirrel)

He said that all of this was necessary to allow the unit the draw air in from other places, so as to not pull water in from the drain pipes. 

[He inserted an extra piece of pvc into one of the sockets on the U-Trap](https://imgur.com/a/0kgHo9Q)

He wrapped up by saying ""your unit may continue to drip, but the air should suck all of the water up. I still don't know why this would be happening....something must have changed in your house."" 

So, in conclusion, here's what I'm facing:

I installed a U-Trap, and I've flushed the system numerous times. This includes attaching a shop-vac to the end of the drain-line, and pouring water into the drain pan. When the aforementioned panel is not attached, there is no water drippage; however when it **is** attached, water seems to drip almost right away. Several experts basically said ""sorry, we have no idea what's causing this...."" and the last one said it's a problem with the power of the airflow, and that something has **clearly** changed in our house, even though nothing has. 

Anyway...I'm just wondering if anyone has any ideas? Drain-line is clear and unclogged...can't notice any rusted holes in the drain pan....coils are clean.....etc etc. Would love any thoughts about what might be stumping all of us =p"

Filling in and compacting dirt after patio removal - help!,3,5,"I just moved into a house where the previous owner had a poorly installed patio. Our goal was to remove all the gravel and plant grass.

 I finally shoveled out all of the gravel (around 10ft x 10ft - 6-8in deep), and proceeded to fill the hole back in with dirt/screened top soil.

How should I go about compacting this soil so that it doesn't sink when I walk on it? I've tried a lawn roller, but it doesn't seem to do enough. Would a plate compactor work better?

I'm worried if I just plant grass as-is, then it will be a muddy disaster when it rains, and I'll leave huge foot prints if I walk through it while it's wet."

"I messed up cutting a basic service cart, now it's sagging severely on one end. How can I fix it?",4,5,"I'm using a basic Harbor Freight steel service cart to hold a forge. The forge sits up top, and on the bottom there's an electric blower. I cut a hole into the side walls of the cart for the blower tube thinking they weren't entirely structural...I was wrong. Now the corner behind the hole I cut (which is right behind one of the casters) is sagging. I'm now extremely concerned about the overall stability against tipping over, especially as the sagging side of the cart is substantially more loaded than the non sagging side because of a very heavy pipe that comes down from the side.

I tried to add some support by connecting a chain in between two J-hooks, one on the sagging side and the other on the top diagonally across. Doesn't seem to have done anything though and I've tightened it significantly.

Here are two pictures, the first shows the sag and the second the chain I attached to try to counter it:

Mod Ryobi 18v Radio,1,2,"Hey everyone!

I was just curious if anyone has done or attempted to add a switch to the USB charging port on the P742 Ryobi 18v Bluetooth radio?

The reason I ask is that when you have the battery pack plugged in, there is a constant drain on the battery whether or not there is anything connected to the USB port. There is only two wires going into it: White (5v) and Black (Ground) that goes from the board to the USB port. 

I was going to cut one of the wires and solder a switch in series from the board to the USB port.  Thinking about it, the mod still will not solve the problem of the constant drain. The only thing the switch will do is let me charge a device or not, but the parasitic drain would still continue. I realize that I would have to go further up into the circuit. I would not know how to trace the board or what to look for.

It would be nice to be able to leave the 18v battery in and not worry about a dead battery when I come back to use the radio after several days. Apparently it is a known issue with the current radio and previous (non-Bluetooth) radio.

Can anyone help?

Best power tool to cut fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together,1,2,"Hello, 

I'm renovating a fiberglass waterfall fixture for a friend and would like to cut out a hole at the back of the fixture so I can access the pump and wiring more easily. This would be about 8x8 inches. Once done, I want to glue it back in to avoid water droplets leaking out. I'm looking for recommendations on the best tool to cut the fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together for this particular case. 

[https://imgur.com/a/26T7oeu](https://imgur.com/a/26T7oeu)

The cut-out section is thankfully not in the path of the flowing water but I suspect that it is close enough to the base where the water falls that some water may occasionally splash back over to this section. I'm away from home and in another country so my choice of power tools are limited. I have access to a drill gun (can borrow) and a angle grinder (can rent). Would the angle grinder be the better choice? if so, what disc size and type should I look for?

&#x200B;

If I may add another requirement/complication - Is there a way to convert this cut-out into a door or make it easy to reopen in the future, in case of repairs? what would be the best way to go about this? I'm imagining a tiny hinge at the back but can't think of how I would make the edges water proof. If it helps the fiberglass structure is cylindrical in shape, and stands at about 3.5 feet."
Concrete mix for DIY hearth,1,4,"I've been wanting to experiment with DIY concrete projects and I have an opportunity to as I am installing a freestanding natural gas stove in my living room this fall that will need a hearth for it to sit on.

When I see people making concrete tables and countertops, many of them are using a specific concrete countertop mixture. 

I am wondering if anyone has used other mixtures or has any recommendations. This slab will be about 3 feet square, and should not have much traffic or use after it is put in place. The stove is around 100 pounds. I am fine with regular gray concrete color but one of my roommates wants to experiment with dyeing the concrete.

My concerns are cost and availability at the local home center (home Depot as well as local hardware stores and lumberyards). I know the speciality countertop mixtures are labeled as higher PSI ratings and crack resistance, good flow and quicker cure time, and I think finer aggregate?

If anyone has a suggestion for an off the shelf bagged concrete or any other thoughts that would be greatly appreciated."

Trying to fix Doorbell,0,4,"So, my doorbell stopped working and I checked all of the common culprits (to the best of my ability) and none of those seemed to be the issue. I checked the cables coming from the transformer (by sticking multimeter probes into the wire nuts coming from the transformer) and got a reading that seemed to indicate the transformer was not the issue. I checked the striker to see if it was stuck, but no, it was fine. The doorbell itself is a very basic run of the mill plastic piece with a light up button. However, the button was no longer lighting up (which is why I initially thought transformer). And when I removed the doorbell and rubbed the cables together, nothing happens. Also, when I place the multimeter probes on the wires that were hooked to the doorbell I get an extremely faint reading (like 0.1) . 

Is there anything I am overlooking? Is it possible that we hung a picture or something and damaged the wiring in the wall running from the doorbell to the transformer? Also, is there any easy technique to checking and replacing the wires without having to tear into the wall/ceiling? This doorbell is on the front door, and the transformer is in the rear of the house by the water heater and furnace. I live in a townhouse. Happy to provide any other info that might help determine the cause and best fix. Thanks for any guidance."

Ungrounded Three Prong Outlets?,7,12,"I was painting a room this weekend and saw an outlet was broken. I went to replace it I realized that it was a three-prong outlet that had no grounding wire connected to it. A quick investigation revealed that none of the outlets in the room were grounded.

One outlet had a sticker saying GFCI protected outlet, but I don't think that was the case as the breaker in the box for that room is just a regular one. In past houses when I've had a basement the actual breaker was GFCI protected and that protected all the outlets on that circuit.

My house is definitely old (1950) and some areas do have legitimate two prong ungrounded outlets, but this took me by surprise.

Short of rewiring the room (eventually), can I simply change the breaker to a GFCI protected one?"

I plan to use a MAPEI brand thinset mortar over a plywood subfloor/hardie backer board. Despite looking at the MAPEI website and Lowes Q&As/reviews, I cannot figure out what the best thinset is. I have narrowed it down to these three:

* MAPEI Porcelain Tile Mortar

* MAPEI Ultraflex 1

* MAPEI Rapid Setting Tile Mortar

Could anyone advise me as to which would be the best? I am concerned about setting time as well as adhesion. MAPEI is closed due to Hurricane Dorian so I cant ask them. Thank you so much in advance!

Hinge Replacement,1,3,"Hi folks! We recently got this (amazing) secretary desk and I discovered it needs a little bit of work. Namely some leveling,  a lock replacement/release and a new hinge for the desk part. The latter is where I need some serious help and guidance. 

I'm a novice DIY-er and have no idea where to start with replacing this hinge. I don't know how to remove it or tell what kind it is. I'm assuming the screws have something to do with it but I don't see anything that is the actual hinge part where the are attached? The hinge itself is just a hair over 4.5 inches/11.4 centimeters in length, if it matters. 

I've tried searching online for ""antique straight hinge"" ""old straight hinge"" and ""old hinge replacement"" (among other similar phrases like HOW TF DO I REPLACE AN OLD HINGE in a moment of frustration)  I can't find any markings on the desk or visible metal parts. I didn't see any similar hinges at my local hardware store. I'm just not sure where to go from here, I feel like I can work out how to replace a hinge once I know how to get another one--I am likely also able to fix it if there's just one part or a disconnect happening.

Removing silicone from windows?,3,6,"We just moved into a house which needs a lot of work. The previous woman to live here suffered from severe mental illness and did a few strange things to the house, all of which are costly to repair.

One of these was that she either siliconed every window shut or stuffed clothes in them until the frames bust. We are replacing the bust windows but can't afford to do all the windows in the house in one go, especially since the doors are similarly damaged. 

I'm wondering if there's some way to dissolve the silicone inside the crack of the window from the outside. The silicone is beaded on the outside going inside the frame, making it so you can't open the window. If we could get rid of this silicone we could potentially save a lot of money.

How to properly cut foam for DIY Ocarina case,4,15,"Hello everyone!

I recently bought a [ceramic ocarina](https://musiquedeterre.fr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/traversier-C3-B.jpg) and I want to make a custom hardcase for it, since I can't find one that I actually like (both strong and not too big, so I can also bring it with me when traveling).

I decided I want to make a wooden case with foam, but I have never worked with it before and I have some questions:

1. How thick should the top/bottom foam parts be? Also, how much foam should leave at the sides (since I intend to cut the shape of the ocarina in a thicker foam that goes in the middle).
2. Should I try to create a concave shape somehow on the foam to perfectly adapt to the ocarina or is it too much work that wont necessarily make it better?
3. Can I just use regular flat foam everywhere or would it be better if I used egg crate shaped foam?

HELP w/pantry shelves,2,17,"*skip to end for short question*

I have a pretty small closet pantry in my kitchen. It had those really flimsy wire shelves originally that would sag with only one cans weight. We also got a roommate and need another shelf...and be able to store more than a few things on each. So I ripped them out and all of the anchors and screws and brackets. 

My initial plan was to buy a heavy duty wire shelving rack and build it inside...so I did. I bought a 36 W 16 D 72 H, 5 shelf rack. However, who ever built my house decided that making my pantry 35 1/2~ wide was good enough, instead of going for the standard 36 inches. 

So, after so much headache and chaos and searching for shelves to fit (there are none) I decided I had to make my own. I went to multiple places but ended up at Lowes, found the only wood they had that was 16 across (need that depth in my pantry for sure). Its only about 3/4 thick but it was my only choice. The boards only came in 8 so rather than create a lot of waste and spend more money than I had, I had them cut each piece into 3 pieces of 32. 

I dont really know anything about building shelves, or using anchors or brackets, or drilling pilot holes, or staining wood...I didnt really know what most of those things even meant before today. I wasnt even sure I owned the correct tools. But here we are. I put the bottom shelf in. The boards are a little bit warped, but not too bad. I put the anchors in correctly (the only stud in that closet is in the corner). I put the brackets in correctly, drilled pilot holes in the boards using the correct size, etc. Butttt it just really doesnt feel that sturdy?? 

I mean, its sturdier than the terrible Rubbermaid wire shelves for sure, but idk... Id put a few jars on it I guess, near the back. But I definitely wouldnt sit on it or plop my kitchenaid mixer on it. 

QUESTION: Is there something I can do to support the front/sides a little more even though the edges of the shelf dont touch the walls on either side? I really want it to be aesthetically pleasing in the end (or as aesthetically pleasing as a pantry can look considering these circumstances). 

[here are some pics of the shelf! (holes are from all the old shelf brackets) grrr ](https://m.imgur.com/a/fFGVxOm)

Need help removing the rancid smell of rotting food that was left in the fridge for 2 weeks without power,5,17,"Super fun Labor Day!

Today, I returned home from a 2-week vacation to Europe, and found the apartment without power. First thing I noticed when I walked in was the rancid smell, and decided to immediately check the fridge. The freezer was filled with maggots feasting on 10lbs. of chicken, 5lbs. of bacon, 10lbs of butter, some hotdogs, and a couple pints of hagen-dazs. The drip pan in the back above the compressor was filled with maggots too. We decided to toss the fridge and its context out, and plan to replace it with a newer model. 

Since then, we've cleaned the whole kitchen twice and scrubbed the floors with Fabuloso 6-7 times. But there's still a noticeable stink in the kitchen and living room areas. 

What can I do to remove the smell?

Custom Marshall Tube Combo build,3,0,"I have had a Marshall Haze 15w tube head and a Peavey Valvestate 112 combo that have both been sitting around collecting dust for a couple of years.   

We are moving soon, as we had plenty of lead time on the move, we have been clearing out old stuff.  I thought to sell the two amps. 

The idea of combining the Haze and Valvestate cabinet came to me, one less thing to move, and use it while my Big Mesa is packed. So I figured it would be worth a try as there wasn't mush wiring which isn't my strength.  

It came together easily, and only required two spots of solder to connect the cable to the speaker, as the amp has a 1/4"" plug in For a single 16ohm, which is what I used.  A Warehouse Guitar Veteran 30 - 12"". 

I flipped the Valvestate cabinet to accommodate the Marshall amp as that was oriented tubes up, redrilled some mounting holes, and reused the hardware from the head enclosure.  Glued on two black tabs to the amp face to close the gap to the edge of the cab. Found an old school looking Marshall Plate on ebay, and I have an awesome little custom Marshall tube combo amp! 

That said... If you know of a foot pedal for a Haze 15, I would be interested, msg me. I can't find one... Thx!

Weber Genesis propane grill repair - huge yellow flames,2,8,"Got my hands on a used Weber Genesis E-330 (knobs on front) propane grill that is in fairly good shape but has some issues. Main issue is that instead of normal blue flames, I'm getting huge massive yellow flames coming out.

I've cleaned out the burners and they appear to be in good shape. Tank itself is fine as it works normally on a different LP grill. Have tried resetting the built-in safety valve on the propane tank using methods found online. Played with the air shutters which did help adjust the intensity of the flames, but even the best possible adjustment is still far from normal.

I looked up the serial # and it appears this was originally converted from a natural gas model, so perhaps something wasn't done properly when it was converted. At this point I am thinking either (A) something needs to be cleaned or adjusted that I haven't thought of yet, or (B) whoever did the conversion did a poor job and didn't do it properly.

Any suggestions of what I can check out to figure out the issue? My thought from here is possibly the manifold... maybe they never changed it when they converted it, or something is faulty with the existing one. Unfortunately I haven't had any luck getting in touch with the prior owner, if he was even the one who converted it in the first place.

If it matters, I'm located in the US. Thanks!"

Generator won't start.,5,24,"Bought a new Craftsman 5000 Watt generator for the incoming hurricane. We always lose power during the storms so I figured I would break down and get one.

Fuel open, choke set properly, switch turned on. It is a pull start and nothing happens when I pull it. I checked the fuel intake and the hose and it is getting gas and nothing is clogged. I mean it is brand new. I opened up the carburetor and found no issues and gas is definitely getting into there as well. Checked spark plug and wire and all is good there. I am not actually able to remove the spark plug though with my tools I need to get something else to remove it to possibly replace it. I have no clue what else it could be if not a defective spark plug or possibly it has the low oil shutdown and it is defective and causing it not to start. any suggestions appreciated....

Eliminating pink mold once and for all?,1,12,"Hi all,

I'm a new homeowner and am dealing with a pink mold/mildew(?) problem in my bathrooms. I think it's in the water because it's in my shower, in the toilets, and in the bathroom sinks. I don't notice it in the kitchen sink so maybe it's in the air and just likes humid/wet surfaces?

Right now our only method of dealing with it is bleaching these surfaces every few weeks when it starts to come back. Otherwise, as we've learned, it starts to climb into our grout and it's horribly painful to deal with. Obviously that is a huge pain in the ass to be doing constantly. 

Is there any options for me to permanently deal with this? Like installing a uv bulb somewhere far upstream on my water line or something? My dad is visiting next weekend and wants to help us with the house and this sort of thing feels like something I'd struggle to do on my own so it would be great if he could help implement a solution.

I was considering also finding ways to test the water or air to see if I could find the source of it...

Any and all comments will be greatly appreciated by this new homeowner. Thanks all for the help"
Shared Wall from Hell - What to Do?,3,35,"Hey guys. A new neighbor moved in, taking over from the quiet spinster who resided there for the last several years. My new neighbor likes watching movies, at times I can only characterize as Holy S**t, NOW??! Im a light sleeper and losing my mind. Building is from the 30s or 40s I believe, if that gives any insight into what sorts of materials were working with. 

I asked the landlord to intervene, or potentially spray some foam in the walls and he said theyre not paying for anything. 

I dont have a ton of money to throw at this problem, but I was thinking of laying some foam insulation (these: https://www.homedepot.com/p/207168829) over the wall, and then making a shiplap out of reclaimed wood to go over it. I would put some thin 1/2x2x8 runners along the studs, the foam panels in between, then the shiplap anchored to the runners. 

Does this seem like a sound plan? Any pitfalls I should avoid? Any alternate materials that would perform better that wont jack the budget up astronomically? Thanks in advance, all! Help desperately needed, sort of at my wits end.

UPDATE: Spoke w/ Neighbor again today. Decided that the first logical step is to float his TV from the wall. We don't share a wall, but given that the walls are probably damn near hollow, it's probably using them as a reverb chamber. So we're going to put a piece of rubber between the TV and the mounting bracket, then some acoustic panels between the TV and the wall."

How do I line up patterned/ornate crown molding with matching corner blocks,5,4,"I'm in the process of choosing which crown molding, I am left wondering about the ornate/patterned moldings. How do you deal with the fact that the wall length is not going to match the pattern length? I've spent hours googling this but obviously don't know the correct terminology to find my answer, help is appreciated.

Example moldings:  [Example 1](https://www.ekenamillwork.com/default/ekena-millwork-mld03x03x04de-3-3-8-h-x-3-3-8-p-x-4-3-4-f-x-94-1-2-l-devon-crown-moulding.html)  [Example 2](https://www.ekenamillwork.com/default/ekena-millwork-mld05x06x08mo-5-1-4-h-x-6-1-4-p-x-8-1-4-f-x-94-1-2-l-monique-crown-moulding.html)

These moldings have corner blocks that match and continue the pattern and not a corner block that the molding dead ends into. How do you deal with it if the pattern is in the middle and not at the end once you hit the other end of the wall? or in the case of the second example molding, the pattern lines up right on one of the protrusions?

An attempt at DIY mold removal leads to a stinkier house..uh oh?,1,10,"I have an old (\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\~1600 sq feet, mostly two story) located in new england.

The first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement. The basement especially had this smell and I'm still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement. There is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s, pretty good!.

In this basement was a giant, moldy, plywood, DIY shelf / wall. Personally I think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement. I demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (Saturday). Then yesterday (Sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask I sprayed a \~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well. I did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement. After my DIY remediation in the evening I closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement.

We awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell. Luckily I suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway.

&#x200B;

Now our first floor really stinks though and I'm worried about the following:

1. I've spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house, joists, flooring, etc will get moldy (though I think that's unlikely...hopefully?).
2. That there is ***another*** source of mold which I can't find that I disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight) .

Any thoughts or tips would be appreciated. 

Basement background:  most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls, not too bad. Never gets too wet down there though can get humid. The kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor. The sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect. Since I can't see it I'm worried about what's going on below the vapor barrier.

DIY Ambilight with Arduino,1,10,"Hi! I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/6eoi75/diy_ambilight_with_ws2812b_leds/) a while ago and it made me really interested in trying to do it myself. Because I've never done a project like this I followed [this youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juC-3imLoTQ) for the arduino connections so mine is slightly different.

I have the arduino set up and (I think) working with the adalight script loaded, but the LEDs aren't turning on at all. I don't see any mistakes with what I've done but I am completely new to it.

Here are some pictures of the solder connections and arduino connections:  https://imgur.com/a/ORY8Ra0

Advice on how to reduce the size of a desk,1,12,"I've never done any serious DIY but I've got a slight issue and any advice would be great. Couldnt find anything online.

I have found a great desk at a stupidly low price in a local store for my new house. The desk is 140cm wide, however the gap i want to fill in my new place is 138cm. Pretty sure the wood is basic maple or something similar.

I was wondering if there was a way to sand down or shave off a cm on each side in order to fit snugly.
Any ideas on what kind of tool i should use? Would i be able to just sand it down with a load of coarse sandpaper? Im not too worried about the leftover scars.

Thank you."

Removing carpet tile from concrete... need to rewaterproof?,1,3,"Hi all! Probably a silly question, but I am working on my basement floor and am currently pulling up carpet tiles. As I pull them up the adhesive is also pulling up specks of waterproofing paint that is on the concrete. Not huge patches, put specks here and there. 

Should I repaint the floor with new waterproofing paint before I put down new tiles?  Or can I get away with not repainting because its only pulling up specks? 


If you have any advice for getting adhesive off concrete, Id love to know, too! Thanks!"
LED Strip Wiring,1,11,"Hello. I've posted about my project before but this seemed like a separate subject. Excuse me if I seem a bit amateurish.

My lights will be 7.5m in length, run on 5V and draw 13.5A. There will be about 5m of gap between various segments and to rejoin the far end to counter voltage drop. Given there's a +V, GND and data wire (which doesn't need rejoining), I need about 11m of wiring. I'm supposing I could get a 3 core wire for the first half and a 2 core wire for the latter (sans data).

I've calculated that I'd need 19 AWG wires minimum. Could anyone confirm if that sounds right? I wonder if the data wire will need the same rating.

I also wonder what the max length the lighting can be. I assume the internal wiring within the LED strip can only withstand so much.

Thanks for reading. I appreciate any and all advice. Counterintuitively, the wiring is becoming the most expensive part."
[HELP] Kitchen Island Countertop Workspace/Cover,1,4,"Hey /r/DIY

I have a nice kitchen in my apartment with a small square island, but the island countertop is tiled, whereas the rest of the counters are flat. I'd love a flat space to work on the island (I cant do a lot of stuff I'd like due to the grout between the tiles), but I'm unsure of exactly how to approach this issue in the most cost-effective manner.

&#x200B;

My main plan right now is to get some 1/2-3/4 in plywood/hardwood to prep for food safety and put rubber feet on so it fits over the original, which would be about $25. 

&#x200B;

If you have any other suggestions for this, please let me know. I think my plan now would work well, but I may simply be missing something else that would work better or be cheaper. I'd really like to do stainless steel, but I know that isn't cost-effective or easy to obtain.

Need help trying to figure out what type of wood my second hand cabinet is made of!,1,4,"Hey guys, 

So me and my girlfriend bought a dated cabinet off a reselling website to turn into a kitchen island (https://ibb.co/FWSrnK4). Its made entirely wood.

Our goal is to make the top look like a butcher block and after sanding it down this is what it looks like (https://ibb.co/bBYgtGj).

We asked some people we know that do some DIY stuff with wood and have heard mixed things about what they think it might be. We would like to know because we are thinking about adding about 10 inches on the backside so we can have an overhang for some bar stools.

Anyways if anyone knows or has a good idea of what type of wood this might be, any help is appreciated."
Advice on how to recreate a lighting setup at IKEA,2,3,"I was eating the IKEA cafe this afternoon and I fell in love with a lighting setup in their seating area. I would love to recreate (in a more condensed form) it for the dining room in the house we just bought. Clearly most of the materials needed for this project I can purchase at IKEA, but the dilemma here is that the room were considering the dining room wasnt meant for that (it currently has a ceiling fan installed) and the ceiling is at an angle. Ive attached photos of both the setup at IKEA and the room itself. Im not even sure how you would describe what exactly this setup is, so googling it has been proven quite difficult; I cant find exactly what Im looking for. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Advice on bathroom reno,1,4,"Being that this weekend is a long weekend we decided to star our bathroom renovations. We are planing on going down to sticks and putting all new stuff in from electrical to plumbing to waterproofing.

So far we have everything torn out except for the old drywall and the electrical. When removing the floor it looks like the old owners in the past at some point, probably the 70s, put in new 1/2"" plywood sub floor over the 1x6 plank sub floor. 

Underneath is 1 5/8""x9"" floor joists (im geussing that technically 2x10?). In some parts of the floor their are 2 1x3 support braces in an x between 2 joists. The 1x6 plank sub floor isn't in the best of shape and probably wont be good for tile unless i stick with Schluter DITRA.

I have watched and read quite a bit on doing my own bathroom reno for about 6 months now and know i want to do either Ditra or Ditra-heat for outside the shower. For inside the shower which we'll make custom, i was thinking about doing the Schluter KERDI shower system with the Kerdi or the Kerdi panels. In order to do the custom shower pan i was planing on doing a mud style pan, i just am unsure about putting that right on top the 1x6 planks as there are larger holes from knots and nails that pounded away a chuck of wood.

Around where the Toilet was there's a lot of discoloration like the toilet was leaking slowly. And certain other areas have a black discoloration as well, not sure if its mold or what, it doesn't smell mildewy but it does smell weird now that the sub floor is exposed.

Im just unsure of the 1x6 planks if i should try and cut that all out and replace with new plywood sub floor or do what was done previous and nail in 1/2in ply on top and then start from there.  

Here are some photos so far, i have specific pictures of around the toilet drain and some dark spots.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/1um7dzz](https://imgur.com/gallery/1um7dzz)

GE LED15ET8G tube bulbs burning out ballasts,3,1,"I bought some led15et8g tube lights to put in the set of 2 Metalux fluorescent fixtures I had in my garage (4 lamp per fixture). These lights are supposed to be able to retrofit into an existing fixture with a ballast, no bypass needed. 

After installing them, the next morning they both died. Checked the switch, and the ends they were wired to, both getting 120v (Ballast is rated from 120 to 277). Just to check I bypassed the ballast on one and they turn on but are very dim, Im guessing this is why the ballast is required for them (Ive seen other LED tubes can have the ballast bypassed) 

I found another fixture I had, a shop one that hangs off chains. Installed 2 of the bulbs and they came on. Less than 10 minutes later the ballast burned out on this one too. 

What kind of fixtures should I be using on these lights? Can anyone link me to some I can order online or get at a hardware store? I didnt expect these to be such a pain."
Adjustable Sit/Stand Desk for Under $200,10,3,"[Full project album here.](https://imgur.com/a/5ck1hWn)

I had a need to build myself a new desk, and decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and make an adjustable sit/stand desk while I was at it. I looked at a lot of off-the-shelf solutions on the market, but since I don't relish a squeaky crank that takes 30+ seconds to raise/lower, or an electrical motor which can fail (I know nothing about electrical), I opted to create one based on counterweights.

There's very little I could find in the way of documentation / inspiration out there, but [this Instructable post](https://www.instructables.com/id/Convertible-StandingSitting-Desk-for-200/) was an amazing starting point. Based on that, I spent some time making modifications, then worked nights/weekends to build my own model.

It's by no means perfect, but it works really well for my needs, and considering it's half the cost of a Varidesk or similar model, it might help someone else here brainstorm an even better way to build their own.

Question about MWBC wiring from panel,1,3,"House built in 1994, I am finishing the basement and am roughing in the wiring. I hired a licensed electrician to install a subpanel as my main panel is full. I was planning on using the existing basement circuit from the main panel for one of the circuits but am confused because the wire is 14/3 from the panel.

Based on my research it appears that this was going to be wired as a multi wire branch circuit set up, i.e. shared neutrals for 2 circuits using a single 14/3 wire.

The issue I am having is after looking at the main panel, I am not seeing any red wires anywhere near the applicable breaker, and as I understand it, to do an MWBC to code, it has to be wired out of a double pole breaker.

What am I missing here?

For reference, the subpanel is only for 4 simple circuits. 1 20 amp bathroom circuit, 2 bedroom circuits with one light and 6 receptacles each, and one circuit for 4 LED hall lights and 9 receptacles. Nothing complicated."

Help Request: Closet Door Finish after removing Frame,2,2,"I need to graciously ask for some help on a mini construction project that I literally evolved from a simple door installation. Heres the down and dirty of what I need help on.

Im installing a rolling door across a closet in my house. Ive built the door & installed the hardware needed. When placing the door on the top rail, that the door frame interfered with the rolling door, so I needed to remove the door frame. What I removed is just the outside frame  which leaves a gap between the rest of the frame that runs along the inside of the closet opening, and the wall.

My question is about finishing it. Would one normally just remove the center piece, and the back frame piece  i.e. take off the entire frame leaving just the bare wall and drywall, and finish it from there? If so, how do I do that? Do I just use a putty to fill in the gaps, or should I put a layer of drywall on top of the wood framing? 

Any help would be appreciated  my end goal is to just get it to a finished state.

Toilet not level.,4,21,"Almost complete with our bathroom remodel, and I'm so stoked.

The tank lid for our previous toilet fell and broke while sitting in the garage. Instead of shelling out an obscene amount of money for a new lid, we opted to just buy a new toilet. 

We got a Glacier Bay Dual Flush toilet from Home Depot. Husband has installed many a toilet before, so I deferred to him for installation.

Bolts in, wax ring on, time to check to make sure it's level!

Holy crap. Not even close.

We took the toilet off to ensure it was level. Yep.

Checked the floor to ensure it was level.
Yep.

Put the toilet back on. Not level.

What could it be? The flange appears to be welded to the pipe itself, so a new flange is not an option unless we want to call a plumber, which we do not.

Sure, we could use shims, but WHY is it so off, when the other ones weren't? 

I've been perusing YouTube for two hours, trying to find the answer. But most videos show flanges that can be removed and replaced. This one can't, so the videos are not helpful."

I've read every comment and done my best to make a better drawing.  This time on my computer so it's slightly easier to read.

My goal is to come up with a 100% accurate, comprehensive drawing, so I can follow it to a T when I'm wiring my campervan, which will be ASAP.  I've never wired anything before, and most of these things in the drawing, I've never touched or seen with my own eyes.  So, I'm a bit overwhelmed.  Anyways, if it's not in [this drawing](https://imgur.com/a/tJ8cl7V) that means I've overlooked it or I don't know it exists.

Feedback and help is super appreciated!  Thanks."

Replacing diagonal deck boards under a screen porch,4,5,"I have a deck where 1/2 the deck is under a screen porch and 1/2 is exposed to the elements. Unfortunately the time has come to replace the deck boards, however only the outside part of the deck needs to be replaced. The inside looks nearly new. The challenge is that the boards are diagonal so in many cases the deck board is underneath the screen porch and then extends to the open deck. I'm hoping to get some advice on how to go about this. I think my options are:

1. Cut the deck boards off at the edge of the screen porch and start the new boards there. My only concern is HOW I will make this cut so close the screened in area. I'd like the cut to be directly next to the screen porch so I can cover it with a piece of trim and hide an unsightly seam. I thought about trying a reciprocating saw. This would only have a seam across the door entry way, but making the cut concerns me.
2. Try and remove each board in its entirety by sliding it out and then sliding the new one in. They are stapled down underneath the screen porch ""walls"" so this will not be an easy task and will also waste many deck boards that are in good condition.
3. Try and strip/sand the outside boards so they can be refinished and leave in place.

Does anyone have any advice or how you've tackled this in the past? Pictures of what I'm dealing with are attached.

Looking for advice on sealing a camera wire running into a vehicle,10,15,"Hey, so I'm going to be installing a whole bunch of [mDVRs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B078X5BH2P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) into a fleet of busses. The cameras use a standard 4-pin aviation connector (I believe it's about 20mm). I obviously want to make sure that the hole going into the bus is sealed so I'm trying to explore my options as far as seals and grommets go. Right now I believe my options are:

1. Get a 20mm generic grommet and cut a hole large enough for just the cable and hope that I can stretch it around the connector
2. Somehow find a 20mm grommet with the center hole the right size for the cable and then cut it so that i can fit in the connector
3. I'm not super keen on this but cut off the connector, run the wire through the grommet, and then splice the connector back on. ~~I believe I could probably get away with doing this separately, before inserting the cable into the hole of the bus but it might make it tough to get the grommet in.~~ EDIT: not sure how this would work actually because i don't have any room to work with inside of the panel to actually splice things together. The hole would just end up being the size of the connector still which wouldn't solve the issue...

Are there any other, better options that I'm missing? What would you recommend? I do plan to silicone around the grommet as well just to seal it better but I would prefer not to silicone in a 20mm hole ha"

Putting room back together after water damage- wall question,8,3,"A water main break in my second home occurred last year. Sadly it wasnt discovered for 2 weeks.  When it was, nearly 1 of water was throughout the lower level of the house (affecting carpet, studs, drywall, etc). I had a remediation company come start the process of removing mold/mildew/moisture.  I also had an air hygienist inspect for residual spores. The house passed muster.  

Fast forward many months and now I have a new tile floor in every room, new plumbing, new electrical, and the studs have been replaced if they couldnt be cleaned. The house is dry and only a faint smell of mildew exists.  I still need the hvac cleaned and upstairs carpeting steamed. 

The drywall was cut 25 from the floor. Since there was evidence of moisture in the walls/floor prior to the flood, Id like to ensure no moisture gets to affect the walls again.  

Should I replace with mold/mildew resistant drywall or could I just place thin insulation and then moisture proof wainscoting?  

Im pretty confident that no further leaks will occur. 

Any other tips on mildew prevention in regards to walls, trim, and floors? 

Thank you for lending your experience and expertise."

The hot and cold connectors were sealed at both ends but water would come through the the faucet base.

Closed Cell Spray Foam Trimming,3,10,"I've decided to remodel my home built in the 50's. I've gutted, rewired, upgraded service, raised ceiling height, replaced windows, and more.

I wish I had done a bit more research on the trimming side of it, because I'm running into the problem of how best to trim it. I've seen everything from people modifying sawzalls for 36"" blades, to the fancy custom planers with the 20+ wire wheels that cost an arm and a leg. 

So my question is, what works well? I havent sprayed yet, but need to do so soon as I have drywall slated for 3 weeks from now. I have a full machine shop if modifying something is the best route, but I would rather not spend 700 on one of the modified sawzall's if there is a cheaper way to still do it effectively, since I won't have a use for it in the future. Also, any advice that might help me out in the spraying would be appreciated!"

"There is a floor above my floor, is this common?",3166,632,"Hey Everyone. I am a first time homebuyer and admittedly, I took on my first house which was most likely above my abilities, but here I am trying to do and learn as much as I can.

&#x200B;

2 Weekends ago, I decided to tear up the old disgusting carpet the previous homeowner had and I was going to lay down some 12mm laminate plank. I got 3 rows of the flooring installed before it because clear that it wasn't going to be possible on the warped flooring due to a lot of sag. I thought it over for a couple weeks and then decided that I would take a trip into the crawlspace (previously unvisited due to not knowing where the entrance was) and take a look at the Joist/subflooring state. I figured I could jack it up, install some support, and it wouldn't be all that bad.

&#x200B;

Enter today.

I cut a small hole in my sons closet so that I could hopefully create a hatch, and then properly fix it after. After cutting the piece of plywood though, I was met with another layer of flooring. I then realized that there were no actual joists that I could see immediately, but 2x4 framing. After putting the pieces together, I realized that the front entrance of my house has a weird 5"" or so step in a doorway that seems a few inches short. It hit me that for some reason, I'm assuming the condition of the true subfloor, that at some point, an owner installed a second floor system above the original.

&#x200B;

is this common? A lot of things in this house were obviously hacked together.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: \[pictures in link at bottom\]

I really did not expect this much of a response holy crap. but anyways:

&#x200B;

So I thought I would come back and update this. I spent a lot of time thinking about this, and then went to Lowes.

The original picture is taken where I planned to put a hatch and is located in the bedroom closet on the (insert obvious joke here) floor, but the flooring I am actually concerned with currently is in my dining room. 

After I found this and read through a bunch of advice, I decided that I would try to cut a bit out of the dining room subfloor and weigh the idea of just doing the second layer subfloor, making it look good, flooring it, and pretending that it never was an issue until I got a chance to actually look under the house.

&#x200B;

WELL THIS WAS NOT THE CASE

&#x200B;

I made a small hole in the living room floor, only to find the actual crawlspace. I then realized that there was actually a 2x6 sitting on top of what I assume was the original joists, raising my floor roughly 5.5 inches, explaining the height difference between the bathroom and the front entrance.

I've decided to rip up all the subfloor, and remove the 2x6's that raise my floor, which should make sense of the entrance and bathroom, and then tie new joists into the existing old ones for strength, while also providing a new straight surface, as well as adding additional supports (the current space between the joists 18"" apart was a 2x8 perpendicular at every 30""s. I'm going to put them at probably every 15""s knowing that its likely overkill, but safer than sorry). After all this I'm going to resheet it with plywood and then lay my laminate (vapor barrier included)

Manufactured home. Water in ducts causing hvac to not work.,2,7,"Hi all.

I just purchased a manufactured home. Long story short... my A/C (package unit outside) stopped working as was freezing up. I tried all possible fixes I knew of and ended up calling in an HVAC company. After inspection the HVAC guys said that water was in the the ductwork under the home. The return run duct was basically shrinking in on itself when trying to pull air into the unit. This makes sense as there had been water seen previously in one of the vents inside the home. Bottom line, they recommended that I replace all of the ductwork which would cost $4,000. Is there anything I can do myself about this? Is it possible to go poke holes in the ducts and drain the water out? What should I do? Any input is appreciated."

"Changing outlet that has 3 live wires, 3 neutrals, and 1 ground. Have a few questions.",4,11,"Hi, 

Images:  https://imgur.com/a/NbXxkFl

I was going to change out this outlet.

It was previously all shoved together in a back-wire type outlet (The kind you just stab in).  Was going to replace with a new side-wire outlet, but wasn't expecting 6 total wires. 

For now, I've just pig-tailed the 3 live wires together, & the 3 neutral wires together, so that the next several outlets down work (crucially, the refrigerator's outlet doesn't work unless these are all connected).  

Couple questions: 

 * So I'd just pigtail in 2 more wires - 1 white wire to the 3 neutral wires, and 1 black wire to the 3 live wires, then connect those to single posts in the new outlet? 

 * Is this not...excessively crowded in that electrical box? Is that OK? 

 * Anything else I'm missing that means I'm going to burn down my house? 

Thanks,

**EDIT: Pigtailed - outlet works, as do the outlets down the line from this one.  Thanks!**

 Ended up going to Home Depot to get red wire connections.  [Link](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Commercial-Electric-Winged-Wire-Connectors-Red-30-Pack-778324/302686289) And also some wire as I didn' thave any [link](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Southwire-15-ft-14-2-Solid-Romex-SIMpull-CU-NM-B-W-G-Wire-28827426/202210510).  That wire you can split the sheath, and inside are a black wire, a white wire, and a bare copper one.  

Then 'just' connect everything  (after twistng the wires into the connector, I used pliers to twist it tighter), then shove everything back in. Fail.  Try again, and done for now at least."

Ridge vents or solar powered attic fans?,0,11,"I live in Mississippi. Very hot and very humid. I have a bit of mold in one area of the attic and have determined that I don't have enough air moving. I am also getting condensation on some of my interior ceilings on particularly hot and humid days. Insulation is fine. I have openings on the south side of the roof to allow for ventilation but no fans, etc.

A friend of mine is suggesting cutting a ridge vent (the house was built in the 1960s and does not have a ridge vent installed). Another suggests installing attic Gable fans at the openings on the south side of the roof. I have ordered the attic fans but I have yet to receive and install them. The ones I ordered are 40 watt each and one of them is listed to adequately ventilate 2250 square feet (my house is about 1800 square feet). 

So which would you do, attic ridge vents or solar powered fans? Or both?"

Can I use caulk around the edges of LVP?,7,22,"We were at floor and decor purchasing LVP. We are redoing our whole first floor with it. About 1600 sq ft.

My basement renovation into a lounge,469,52,"The split-level house was built in the late 60s in the nyc metro area. When I bought this house, the previous owner had fashioned the basement into a spare suite for his ailing father. He eventually passed away and the room sat unused and un-updated for years.  
  

I wanted to turn it into a lounge with a bar and have a means to display collectables and host parties. Our design taste is a mix between rustic, industrial, contemporary, and transitional, but we also wanted the room to look appropriate with the rest of the house and tried to take design cues from the upstairs.  
  

The renovation took approximately 7 months of on/off work on weekends and after work. I set the gallery up in sections for the demo, electrical, fireplace, framing, drywall, and then all the finishing work and included descriptions along the way.  
  

I hope you enjoy!

My son's house is a moldy disaster.,7,8,"I'll try to make this short.  Son bought a 1950's ranch home in the country about 6 years ago.  2 years ago they started smelling mold and after it got worse discovered it was coming from the end of the house, bedroom walls.  So they replaced the roof, took up the wet insulation in the attic, used something to kill mold in the rafters, new insulation.  Also took out some of the drywall in the bedroom around a window, and I can't remember what was done there, but son supposedly fixed, repaired/repainted last winter.  This spring/summer the smell returned.  Last week he pulled the siding off the end of the house and revealed it was siding over cedar.  (why this was done in the past I have no idea).  Son discovered the two windows on that side of the house hadn't been installed properly, they were leaking down into the walls.  I helped him paint Zinsser mold killing primer over the 2x4's and everything we could reach with a paintbrush.  (I think I was painting the backside of the 2 bedroom's drywall).  I believe his plan is to replace the insulation, fix the windows, reapply the siding and hope for the best.  I'm his mom and don't know more details, just know what I smelled yesterday and it is awful.  His wife and children have been sick every month since they moved into the house.    Has he done enough to eliminate this?  He's worked so hard and I'm so worried for them.  If the leaks are all stopped, will the mold continue now that it has had such a firm hold on the house?"

Fridge Water Supply/Icemaker Line: Braided SS vs Pex?,5,10,"Hello,

We live in an apartment but own our own fridge. I want to add a water supply/icemaker line. Ive been doing a lot of reading and it seems that it isnt unusual to have to run it under/through cabinets and across a cooking range.

What I see much less of is consensus between what to use for supply line. We wont use copper or the cheap plastic but Ive seen good things about both pex and braided stainless steel lines. I just wondered what you think of each, which you prefer, and why. Is one less likely to have issues than the other? That would be helpful to know in an apartment setting. I will install a proper splitter valve (no saddle) and shutoff. Its a fairly long run. Ive read that theres no length limit issues w/ this type of line. Ill be a fairly long run - probably 25ft (including the extra to pull out the fridge). 

Any thoughts you could share would be brilliant. Thanks so much in advance!

(Hopefully this doesnt get flagged bc its not getting started or any of the other things in the prohibited list for the forum...)"

"10yr Cedar fence w/o stain... tried using cleaner and it's a nightmare, so is it safe to powerwash instead?",8,6,Bought my home and didn't realize the fence was not stained. Ten years later and I'm trying to restore it from the weathered look it has acquired. Home Depot staff told me to use Behr cleaner on it because they said powerwashing is thought to push water too deep into the wood. But pretty much hate my life with this cleaner because I'm scrubbing until my arm about falls off and at this pace it will take about 20-30 hours of total scrubbing to clean a short fence that spans only half a 50x150' house lot in the city (aka not much fence). There has to be a better way. Did HD get it wrong? Is it safe to powerwash and then stain/seal a few days after? Grateful for any advice on this!

"Backyard getting a facelift, need advice",2,5,"Good evening Reddit!

Wife and I are planning to fix up the back yard (16' x 13') in the immediate future.  Currently getting quotes to replace the fence (20' long x 13' wide (including gate), and if it costs too much, I'll be doing it instead.  Once that's done I'll be regrading the yard, installing some type of drainage system, and putting in new pavers.  I've done most of this work before at my parents' house, friend's houses, etc.  The one thing I haven't done is drainage, which is why I've come asking for help today :)

The back door and the gate are in opposite corners of the yard.  The gutter downspout comes down right next to the back door and just dumps the water there.  While I haven't had any flooding issues, I just don't like it.  I originally wanted to just extend the gutter out of the yard, but that's going to be a long pip in the middle of the yard and again, I don't like it.  After spending the day at working looking at drain stuff, I think I have the basics down, just don't know how to finish it.  

I'm thinking I could put a grate under the downspout to collect the water, then install a french drain along the side of the yard, terminating into a dry well at the edge of my yard (haven't decided whether to do it just inside my fence or just outside).  What I don't know is how deep does a french drain need to be buried?  I've read that it should be roughly 12 inches deep- is that 12 at the bottom or top of the pipe?  Also, if you look at the picture from the back gate, you may notice orange markings- that's the cable line.  They never buried it, so I will (probably put it in a pvc pipe).  Next, if I have the french drain terminate at a dry well, do I need to have an outlet from the well, or does it just end there?

Tight staircase - Need Some suggestions,2,3,"My basement stairs need a proper banister and balusters for safety and to meet building code (Ontario).  I'm having a hard time visualizing how these stairs will look when finished and google hasn't turned up good finished examples of people having done similar.  Here's pictures of my stairs and pics from a neighbor with a similar layout (with banister added, no balusters).

 [https://imgur.com/a/bHTdAMS](https://imgur.com/a/bHTdAMS) 

My problem is that the stringer for the stairs is in line with the drywall on top.  I want a handrail that goes the full length of the stairs, and balusters.  Between the baluster tops, wall and handrail, I'm not sure how to make it fit.  Newel post I can do easy, handrail is harder.

**Sweep Handrail** \- I cannot find a picture of someone sweeping a handrail around a ceiling transition like that, only a vertical wall transition.  The problem is that the handrail needs to sweep in about 4 steps before the side is closed off.  So I'd need to have 4 steps with balusters in the middle.  I'm wondering why I can't find a pic anywhere of anyone who has done this though.  Everyone who puts a regular banisters over the stringer in these situations seems to end it at the ceiling and leave a big gap.  [Example](http://macmillanandsoninc.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1522236158-striped-stair-carpet1-960x1280.jpg)

**Pig's Ear handrail -**  [Example](https://www.loveskirting.co.uk/images/solid-walnut-pigs-ear-handrail-3-6-metre-p465-12747_image.jpg). I could put a Pig's Ear handrail directly over top the stringer.  I would cut a section a drywall out to recess the rail so that the outside of the stringer and the outside of the rail are aligned.  Then I could use simple round tube spindles to baluster.   Drilling proper holes into the bottom of the Pig's Ear might be challenging.  Not sure how this will look in the end.

Anyone have any other suggestions or ideas?  Or other finished examples?"

Basement Master bathroom redo question,2,5,"Hi all, my husband and I bought a split level (built in 1979) a few years back. We've been slowly remodeling the entire thing, and it's become a chore because of the previous owners cutting corners with everything. Anyways, recently found some water damage in the basement bathroom (Master). We decided to just gut the entire thing and make a nice updated bathroom. It right now only has 1 bowl sink vanity, corner shower, toilet. I said we should just call a plumber and make it a 2 bowl vanity since it's our master bathroom and that would appeal to home buyers when we go to sell. My husband is now suggesting we move the toilet and keep a one bowl vanity a but have an enlarged shower. 


My question is, in everyone's opinion, is it worth more for us to have a double vanity or an enlarged shower. Which will be better for resell? Thanks!!"

How much spacing is needed for a single vinyl stair tread,3,5,"I recently purchased some vinyl stairs treads along with additional vinyl flooring. The instruction manual for the flooring planks claims that I need 1/4"" of spacing. There are no instructions for the stairs treads themselves.

I can see where 1/4"" would be necessary for large portions of vinyl planks in hallways/living rooms ect. But when we are just talking about a single piece stair tread, Im wondering if 1/4"" on each side would be necessary. Right now im considering leaving 1/8"" on each side of the stair treads. Does anyone have experience with this kind of thing?

It might also be worth noting that its about as warm as it gets where I live right now. I dont expect the vinyl to ever be much warmer than it is right now.

New House Paver Patio + Fire Pit + Retaining Wall,36,17,"I graduated residency and my wife and I bought a house in the Twin Cities (MN) and we decided to undertake a little (enormous) backyard renovation! I had 8 weeks off and in between some traveling, the entirety of the project took about 4 weeks (roughly 60-80 hours of total labor). This is something I had never done before so I'm sure others could do it quicker and it was also all done by hand. Enjoy!

[Final product](https://i.redd.it/0sbroevy7aj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[This was an area that the previous owners had a trampoline in. Seems a little dangerous to me with a boulder retaining wall right there, but what do I know. Anyways, I loved the idea of a circular paver patio as it seemed like a nice little cove with a lot of privacy. I measured out the desired area to be about 16 feet in diameter.](https://i.redd.it/6bje2qvs8aj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[The ground was fairly soft luckily, but unfortunately a lot of this excavation was done when it was about 90 degrees with a heat index of 115 F. Gotta love Minnesota summers! I dug the left side near the boulder retaining wall down about 10 inches and the other end down about 6 or so. I was nervous about digging any closer to the boulders as I didn't want that to come crashing down and turn this into a much bigger project than it needed to be. Lots of roots that needed to be cut. Eventually I tamped all this down as well before placing the gravel later on.](https://i.redd.it/hkfqqitj9aj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Tracing out my retaining wall trench that needed to be dug. Roughly 20 linear feet. ](https://i.redd.it/3dmod3q4aaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[You can see the boulder wall again on the left side. Again, I didn't want to dig much closer to this than I did although now I wish I had extended the wall about one more block. Oh well, still turned out well and I really didn't want to mess with the integrity of that wall. I also didn't dig this trench wide enough initially.](https://i.redd.it/uu4654p1kaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Beginning to lay the first row on top of 5 inches of compacted class 5. The first row needs to be perfectly level so it was more time consuming than anticipated. Plus, each block was 84 lbs so they weren't the easiest to move into place. In total, I moved over 27,000 lbs of material by wheelbarrow.](https://i.redd.it/23ammmh2eaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[First row laid. Starting to take shape.](https://i.redd.it/4swvzuezcaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Two or three rows up. Added some keystone to help with drainage. I discussed with the people at the landscape store multiple times whether I needed a drainage pipe or not, but they insisted I did not as it was only going to be 28 inches high. As I said earlier, I needed to dig this trench a little wider to fit the stone, but it wasn't as bad as I initially thought. ](https://i.redd.it/h7u68r9mdaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Wall complete aside from the caps and starting to back fill. ](https://i.redd.it/ya7xldehfaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Finally all back filled. A lot of the dirt I excavated originally had to be brought back in to level it out. Definitely a lot more than I expected, but I didn't want to dig that left side down any further. I used a plate compactor on this before placing the class 5.](https://i.redd.it/ehn0k0xnfaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Class 5 down and compacted. I was pretty exhausted at this point, but encouraged by the progress and excited with how it looked. ](https://i.redd.it/qx1uit00gaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[Leveled an inch of sand and started laying pavers. A good set of knee pads saved me. Really starting to take shape now. ](https://i.redd.it/hzvwimwogaj31.jpg)

&#x200B;

[All stones laid and edging in place. It's about 15.5 feet in diameter, so just a little smaller than originally anticipated, but very happy with the look of it. Laying the pavers alone took me about 10 hours total. ](https://i.redd.it/6wjlgpbugaj31.jpg)

Replacing Hurricane Shutter Anchors/Bolts with Epoxy. Need Help and Advice.,1,1,"So, I'm putting up the hurricane shutters on my parents' home.

I've never done any kind of work like this before, so I'm wondering how to do it step by step.   
Do I just fill the holes with epoxy and then drop the anchor in and let it cure?  The anchors also seem to be open in the front and back, so I'm worried that the epoxy is going to seep in when I push them into the epoxy. Should I just put the bolt in to prevent this when I put them in?"

AC furnace leak?,2,19,"(also posted in r/homeowners, hoping to figure this out before having an HVAC co come out)

Hi all. The other day, I came home to a musty smelling basement (which was odd- we've never gotten water). Found that my utility closet had quite a bit of water on the floor though. I turned off the AC and was hoping it was just an issue with the condensate pump or line. Cleaned those all out, thought they were fine.

I just turned the AC back on today to see if it fixed the issue because I couldn't see where the water was coming from originally. Needless to say, it's still leaking.

There's a PVC line going to the condensate pump that's fine and dry. I know nothing about AC, but there is another hole right to the left of that pipe that is leaking down into a hole in the furnace, then onto the floor. It actually looks like it was only covered in duct tape and the tape broke free? Seems very odd.

Can I just cap that line off? Should I run something from that into the condensate pump? Should I call a pro? Total noob here.

We've lived here just over a year and of course didn't renew our home warranty, which ended last month.

Have tried the breakers, etc. And no luck whatsoever.

Fastening sill plate to concrete slab,1,9,"I'm going to be installing a couple of new walls in my basement for a new bathroom. What type of fasteners do you guys recommend for fastening the sill plate to the concrete slab? The walls will be non-load bearing, so the fasteners are just there to keep the bottom of the wall in place. Right now the options that I know of are:  


1. Wedge anchors. I think these are going to be overkill and more expensive than necessary for a non-structural application
2. [Tapcon concrete screws](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Tapcon-1-4-in-x-3-1-4-in-Hex-Washer-Head-Concrete-Anchors-75-Pack-24301/202516409)

I have no problem using a hammer drill for whichever anchors I choose. I've also used Tapcons before for other applications and didn't have any issues with them.  


Thanks in advance!

Insulation Question for Media Cubby in Kneewall of unfinished attic space.,1,3,"I'm currently finishing an above the garage bonus room that already has the sub-floor and knee walls in place.  I'm framing in a built in media cubby in one of the knee walls.  I should mention that the back side of the knee walls & cubby will remain unconditioned attic storage space.  The cubby will be about 60""W x 25""H x 24"" D.  The finished bottom of the cubby will be 5.5"" **above** the sub-floor.  My question is how to insulate that void between the finished bottom of the cubby and the sub-floor?  Should I be leaving a 1"" gap under any type of insulation placed here? I was thinking that I could use rafter vents?  Any advice is much appreciated.  Thanks"
need some advice/input for cement basement steps,3,4,"hi there. was hoping someone with more experience than I could give me a bit of advice about my outside basement entrance top step. I had a bunch of old sidewalk behind my house leading to these, and the concrete was all broken and bucking and needed to be replaced. when i started working on it, I realized that there was an issue with the steps, that the previous owner had kind of quick and dirty ""fixed"". it's pulled out about an inch or so from the rest of the basement steps. Unbeknownst to me the previous owner had filled it with sand and then some (like, 1/4-1/2"") cement on top. 
On the outside of the top step, there is roughly 6-6 1/2"" of concrete sitting directly on the soil.  
I do not think i have a pic of it, but the cement goes down at an angle matching the steps, and the rest of the stairs seem fine. this top step is the only one that has pulled away and broken over the years.
I am assuming i should dig down here when i re-pour this step, I am just not sure how far.  

I live in the Philadelphia, PA area, we have a clay-ish soil here.

and I know that the frost line depth for fence posts etc. is 18"", and foundations is like 36""... I just don't know how deep to dig to stabilize this. like, do i need 18"" of solid concrete under here, or a foundation of stone and rubble and then a few extra inches of concrete or...? 
also, is there a way to secure it to the rest of the steps? should i try and drill through the one under it and add rebar or something?

I talked to a concrete guy, and kinda got a ""well just repour the step and ignore it if you arent gonna stay there forever"" but i think thats not super cool.

Need ideas and/or advice for a deck gate,1,3,"We have a second-floor condo that has a staircase leading to our back deck (and the one for the condo above us) and need to put in some form of gate. We're not allowed to alter the railing, though, so it limits our options.

The previous owner used a piece of lattice attached on one side with zip ties as hinges and then ""latched"" with a bungee cord. The lattice ended up breaking when left open on a windy day, which wasn't a terrible tragedy because it was cheap and getting very saggy anyway.

Since then we've been using a baby gate connected on either side with bungee cords. This was never intended to be a permanent solution, though, because it's not secure, annoying to put back in place (we exit via our back door 99% of the time,) and now unsafe for our toddler since she can easily unlock the screen door to get outside and can't resist either rattling the gate or playing with the bungee cords, and I'd like to replace it before she manages to knock it loose and fall down the stairs.

Right now it feels like our best option is to just get a new piece of lattice and go back to the old way (except with a fastening solution other than a bungee cord since the kid is too smart for her own good and will defeat those soon) but I'm open to other ideas.

Thanks!

tl;dr: I need a deck gate without any drilling or other rail-altering installation required."

Help! Need air conditioning advice for new apartment!,2,22,"I just moved into a brand new apartment and it is sweltering hot. It's got 10' high ceilings and a concrete floor and it's under 60 degrees outside, yet even with nothing running in the apartment and all the windows as open as possible, it is still 80 degrees inside at 4am. The apartment doesn't have traditional windows, they are the kind that angle out and give about 5 inches of an opening on the bottom (I've attached a picture at the bottom of the post.)   

I'm trying to figure out the best solution. I don't think those windows come off easily enough to get a regular window ac in, and even if they did my landlord will probably be hesitant as the building is brand new. Everything I read about portable ac units is that they are trash, but running the two hoses up to my windows and cutting a frame to fit inside them would be fairly easy I think. 

I run really hot when I sleep so if I can't stay cool at night it makes my life a living hell. Anyone have an experience with cooling down an apartment like this?

I dont know how or which regulator i should use since I'm not good at electric stuff.. My goal with this project is to be able to hook up a usb to the vertical turbine to be able to charge phones with their specific chargers..

https://i.redd.it/79dgqa78c4j31.jpg

[https://imgur.com/a/nXffAyF](https://imgur.com/a/nXffAyF)

I recently stumbled upon a pair of well-used tools gone by the wayside, an old dunlap wood lathe and a craftsman 6"" jointer.  First up on the restoration block was the jointer.

First step was attacking the beauty with a wire wheel and wire brush, removing as much rust as I physically could from both the deck, the body of the jointer, and the base.

The hardware went into a vinegar + salt bath to soak for 24 hours.  They were removed, scrubbed with a toothbrush/steel wool, given a quick soak (10 minutes) in water + baking soda, then dried with a blowdryer and prepped for painting.

Then was the fun part; I taped off bare metal areas and tapped into my inner artists.  Copper and Steel is my favorite color combo, and spray paint is amazing.

Flooring advice request: Removing wood floor glued to original hardwoods.,31,17,"Hey All! As the title states I currently have a layer of wood veneer flooring that is glued to what I believe are the original hardwoods.  Home built in 1947. From the crawlspace I can see what I believe is roofing paper between the original hardwoods and a wood plank subfloor.

I'm about halfway through pulling up the top layer, but there is a lot of scraping to be done and I'm unsure of the best course forward. Leaving me with a few questions.

1) Should I pull up the original hardwoods as well? The floor is sagging a bit and I'm wondering if I should pull everything up and put osb over the existing subfloor then lay down new hardwoods. Although the additional time and cost of this is a little concerning.

2) Would it be a mistake to just get enough of the glue up and then re-glue down a new floor over the top of the original hardwoods again?

3) I've gouged the original hardwoods in a few places. If there is a possibility sand them back to workable shape, what would be a good way to address the more severe spots?

So my sink just gave out..,11,17,"Sink plughole help https://imgur.com/a/oGTYnlk

My sink plughole just gave out, judging by the insides it's quite old...

I'm hoping things can just be slotted back into place and hold with a bit of silicone, but I'm struggling to figure out how this is meant to go? The top bit has notches cut out which look like they should fit into notches on the piece which comes up through the plughole but there is no ""opposite"" piece to slot into?

The pipe which comes from below and up through the hole drops without any support, and since it doesn't screw into the bit above, I'm struggling to see how this should work?

My fix was going to be just place everything back in position with a bunch of silicone and hope for the best, but there was no silicone when it fell apart so there must've been some mechanics in place to hold it all together.

Is silicone an option? Or just buy a new plughole and pipe connector and screw that in?

"Looking to Make my First Homemade Lava Lamp, Any Help is Appreciated",7,2,"So I like lava lamps quite a bit. The idea of making my own was always a thought, but I never quite had the drive nor the motivation to build one up until this morning. So I've done some moderate research on the topic already (free time and dead spots at work allow it). Most results gave me mineral oil glitter lamps which is not what I'm seeking. Here's some basic info that I can provide for peer review/cross examination.

I have a Jack Daniels bottle (750ml) and I think it'd be the perfect container for a lava lamp. I also hate just throwing away glass bottles that have nice etchings on them. The bottle itself was what sparked the interest.

 I can make a basic light stand for it no problem with basic pvc piping or a can/fixture from an electrical retailer or any crafts store (at least in Chicago) and would most likely use a 40w bulb given the size and density of the glass bottle.

I know the wax mixture is typically paraffin (I've also heard it's a mix of paraffin and beeswax) which can ve acquired at most places, Wal-Mart comes to mind. But as for the rest of the set up I'm rather lost.

I've heard mixed things on the liquid mixture. I know it isn't straight water. I've seen one instructional video that lists a mixture of 71 percent rubbing alcohol and 91 percent rubbing alcohol, but the consistency of the globules in that video were runny and small, not like the large globules of wax you'd see in a traditional commercial lamp. 

In tandem with that I'm not sure how I'd color the wax. I've also seen that using oil pastels in the wax mixture will give it a desired color. Any help or an instructional how-to from other lava lamp diyers would be amazing. This would totally become a hobby of mine once I get the ropes down, I just need to get the ball rolling on this first one. Thanks in advance!"

After 2 weeks, ive noticed a wet towel odor in my son's bedroom. I opened the ceiling in the closet (its right underneath the laundry) install ventilators in the area, i went buy a 70pint deshumidifer and since then... i hope for the best. The odor is still there by far less persistant.

I feel so ashamed of not having called the insurance and restoration company right away. Im just stressed out about making the right next move without ruining our finance. Now i'm stuck with terrible dilemnas.     
    
- Throwing the towel and spending thousands of dollars to fix a problem

- Gut the wall and closet where i think it leaked (its a wall with insulation). If i had tons of experience in it, id go for it but i will have to rebuild that with youtube.   
   
- Can i still call/claim my insurance so late in the process?"

Updating two honey-colored oak tables: can I use gel stain to avoid stripping/sanding?,9,7,"I have a square table and a side table that are Amish-made oak with the dreaded honey-colored stain on them. The surfaces are all blessedly flat, so I'm thinking that it would not be too hard to refinish them with a darker stain (walnut to espresso). Before I go out and buy stripper and an orbital sander, I am wondering if anyone has experience using gel stain. I have heard you can apply it over existing stain if you are going for a darker color. If this is the case, I might even update the four chairs I have that match this set-- they are far more detailed and there would be no way I'd sand them down. I was going to just look to buy new chairs to match the new stain, but if I can easily update the existing ones I'd be all for it."

Fridge Water line installation,2,7,"I purchased and moved into a new home, which has a nice fridge with ice maker and water.. but lacks a water line to hook it up to.

My DIY level is fairly low, but I'm confident I can run a simple water line from the sink (pictured) to the fridge.. by cutting a few small holes in the cabinets and running it behind them.

In the picture you can see the cold supply line for my kitchen sink. It has what looks like  a capped connector, can I use that for the water supply line to the fridge, or should I look at installing a secondary valve off of the first, or..?

My plan is to run either PEX or braided steel to the fridge. The run is about 15 ft.

Best options for cheap light blocking?,11,17,"Hello, DIY.

I'm currently homeless and am renting an office on am upper floor section of a warehouse, which offers a single room for working. I put my things in here and use the restrooms for washing and showering. 

The ceiling has always-on bright LED lights. I removed a couple of them, but the place is still completely bright- I sleep here and its unbearable to have them shining down on my face.

A friend of mine had a 48 section of insulation he left, and I realized it provided a nice rigid and light-proof option for installing a ceiling. I'll only be here for a few months (until end of this semester) and I really want to sleep soundly.

Is rigid insulation the best option for cheap light blocking? I could go with, say, a curtain, but it would be harder to keep ""flat"" like the ceiling I would like would be. 

I am looking for other pieces of large, flat and rigid pieces of hardware that are cheap like this rigid insulation. Help me get a good night sleep, redit!

Please help! Inglis gas dryer not heating,5,9,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

I have this Inglis gas dryer, model number G072002, and it's not blowing the hot air.

&#x200B;

I would like to know the parts numbers for a high-limiter thermostat, cycling thermostats, solenoid coils, igniter kit for Inglis gas dryer for this gas dryer. I also want to know whether any igniters can be used for this model.

&#x200B;

I opened it up and removed the drum so I could take a look at it. I couldn't find a thermal fuse. I haven't checked thermostats with a multimeter yet. I suspect the igniter and solenoid, but at this moment I am not 100% sure which one needs to be replaced. I cannot find any parts for this model from parts online shops. I wasn't able to find a repair manual either. I think I can buy thermostats but the igniter look nothing like I could find any of those part online shops. I wonder if I can use any of those igniters.

Thanks in advance!

Rental: stacking things on gas oven,2,2,"Hello! I've recently moved into a 50s-era rental house that has limited kitchen space. There's a little gas oven and a hob next to it. It would be great to use the space on top of the oven for food prep, or for my kettle/toaster, but naturally it gets quite hot. 

I was considering grabbing some fire-resistant board to pop on top so I can use it as another surface, but I'm not sure if it's safe or a great recipe for fire. 

When I've been researching, most of the guidance is for electric ovens or gas ovens that have a hob on top, rather than the oven on it's own. Some things I've read have discouraged it, but usually due to ventilation concerns which is not a concern in this case because there's no ventilation on top.

Tl;dr Is putting a fire-resistant board on top of a gas oven and then leaving your electric kettle or toaster on top a recipe for fire? 

Thank you very much!"

Tile project - Discovered a triple layer of very thin backer-board under tile,3,8,"I just tore up the tile in my second floor bathroom, and I only have experience doing tile work on my first floor and directly on the slab.  Hopefully the link I attached is functional and you can visualize what I have going on with my second floor.  It appears that the previous owner secured some type of mulit-layer backer-board right over the existing linoleum flooring, and then tiled over that.  I'm confused because there are three very thin layers of backer-board and when I pulled the tile I cleanly removed the top thin layer of backer-board.

I'm thinking that maybe I got lucky and can just tile over what is left on the floor (the 2 thin layers of backer-board), or I'm screwed and have to pull everything up and start from scratch.  I've never seen or used this very thin (each layer is \~3/32"") backer board so it's throwing me off.  Is it possible that the previous installer intentionally used this triple layer so that the next install would be quick and easy? Has anyone ever used or seen this technique before?

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

EDIT: After some research, I have learned that the ""multi-layer"" underlayment that I am seeing is a result of the 1/4 Hardibacker ""delaminating"".  Apparently, older versions of hardi are laminated. Plan is to demo everything down to the subfloor and put down new 1/4"" hardi.

Rehabbed master bath that was in dire need of a facelift,30,13,"Let me preface by saying I have very little experience with any kind of rehab, but I have been reading this sub for several months. So between this and many dozens of hours of YouTube how-to videos, my confidence level was just enough to begin demoing something. I decided my drab master bath would be my first project. I mean, how hard could it be, right? 

I apologize for the sporadic photos as it wasn't my original intention to document the remodel. But at some point I figured it would be good to get opinions from this knowledgeable community. 

I didn't do anything that might be considered overly difficult. I did find some bonus space behind the prefab shower so I tiled it in and made a larger shower with a bench. 

The only thing I didn't do myself was a bit of plumbing- had to have the shower valve changed out (wasn't aware of this until after shower was tiled so had to cut access hole from back side) and also had the plumber hook up the sink which required a fair amount of cutting to the back of the vanity. 

Total cost was in the $3k-$3500 range. I suspect this is considerably cheaper than a contractor would have charged, though I didn't get any quotes. 

Entire project took 9 or 10 weeks of part-time work, but I was in no rush. Biggest surprise was cost and meticulousness of waterproofing the shower alcove.

Hope you all don't slay me too badly!

Is it possible to operate a bank of LED ceiling lights that is controlled from 3 locations with a dimmer switch?,3,6,"We recently had our kitchen remodeled (not DIY), and part of that process was installing a bank of 7 LED ceiling lights. They are slimline canless LED lights that are 15W / 120V / 60Hz and claim to be dimmable in the product listing and in all the included documentation. (Not including a link to the exact product because I think that may be against the rules.) All the lights are controlled as a group and cannot be turned on or off individually. There are 3 different switches that can turn these lights on and off, and they are wired correctly where each switch will turn the lights to the opposite state of what they currently are.

The electrician was originally going to install a dimmer switch, but didn't for some reason. I wasn't around when this happened so wasn't able to ask him why, and I have no direct way to contact him as he was a subcontractor.

Are the lights actually dimmable with this setup? I have a limited understanding of all this stuff, but I've swapped out a few light switches and wall plugs when necessary. I feel comfortable enough doing that, but I just have no idea what I need to actually accomplish this.

I only need to be able to dim the lights from one of the switches. Even though the lights can be controlled from 3 different switches, we rarely use 2 of them.

I'm not looking for an exact product recommendation, but I just need to know what terms and specifications I should look for when selecting a dimmer switch to accomplish my goal. From the research I've done, I'm guessing I just need a single 3-way switch that is capable of handling at least 105W? (I would also like to get a smart switch if possible, assuming there is one available that fits my needs.)"

UnF'ing old plumbing vent.,0,12,"So I'm doing a bathroom renovation in a property I recently bought. I'm taking the bathroom down to studs and just ran into my first major issue.

The stack is cast iron, and at some point was monkeyed with. They put PVC in for the bathroom drains. However above where the bathroom drains to the stack, the old CI was left in place, just hanging in the wall (and secured to non structural studs). That same CI also goes up and out as the vent. So there's a bunch of CI stack left in the wall (open on both ends), and not secured very well.

I'm thinking Im going to want to cut that out, and replace it with PVC, and get a proper roof vent again. What I'm not sure about is how to secure it, when I'm cutting it out. I'd say it's approximately 15 feet (from the bathroom floor, out through the attic). 

The stud that it's currently strapped to is non structural (it's toenailed into the floorboards). So I  don't trust that to continue to hold that stack up. I'm looking to add more strapping for now for additional support and peace of mind.

Is strapping and cutting smaller sections going to be the way to go?
I was also thinking of adding some boards under the current opening (across the floor opening) for additional support.

I definitely appreciate any insight or feedback, thanks!

[Request] Need help converting a 110v outlet to a 220v for a Clothes Dryer (NY).,1,39,"So I just moved into a house and failed to realize when I bought it, that the laundry hookup only has 110 outlets. The previous owner had a gas dryer, so that's all they needed. 

Now, I brought my dryer that's <1 year old to the house and realized the problem. I looked up how to fix the issue, either by converting the dryer to a 110 with a step down converter or the outlet to a 220 by running a wire from the breaker box and making it its own breaker. I'm wondering if anyone has experience doing projects like this and if they could give their opinion on what is the better idea and what would be the best way to go about making those changes?

Advice on how to fix scratched up wood floor,11,15,"Hi all, I'm looking for advice on how I could fix an area of wood flooring that has taken a beating the last few years. [Picture of the affected area. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/SGtMfYt) From what I've researched, it may just require a new coat of finish. I'm completely out of my element here. If that's the way to go, how do I identify the finish that I must buy? And do I just apply it to the affected area? Wouldn't that look out of place? Do I sand before and/or after? If not just a finish, what do you recommend? Appreciate any advice. Thanks!  
Edit: Wanted to thank you guys and update you of the fix. As someone suggested below, the color was the color of the wood and all I ended up doing was a single coat of some wipe-on poly. [It came up pretty well. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/y4HJFQU) Thanks again!"

What is this curtain attachment?,4,7,"So we've just moved into a new house and several of the curtains are literally falling down.

There is a stud on the topside that slides into a keyhole opening on the bracket (edit: it's this stud that is breaking and causing the curtains to fall down).

I've spent a good few hours googling this and can't find a thing, it's driving me crazy. I don't know where to go from here, does anyone know what these pieces are, or even what the curtain system/brand is called? Much appreciated if anyone can help. Thanks!

Simple attic insulation rehab?,4,10,"So we bought a new house and it has a cheaply built ""cottage"" in the backyard. I'm trying to rehab it as a home office.

First thing I ran into was a bad ceiling & attic insulation. Crumbling drywall, water damage, mold, multiple layers of old material that had settled down to about 4-6"". So ripped it all out.  Roof deck, underlayment and shingles were also redone only a couple of years ago.

After a few electrical improvements, I'm considering my insulation options. It's a simple 26x14 building. 2x4 Rafters with 1x4 king posts every 48"" and three rows of 2x4 running the length. 

No ridge vent or soffits, just a Gable vent on each end.

I'm in Kansas City, Missouri. DOE recommends R38-R60 in attics around here. We have pretty hot muggy summer and cold wet winters! Yay.

I don't really have the budget for open cell spray foam. But I still want this to last 20+ years. I also really don't like the idea of blown in because I *really* want to be able to go up there and make future modification and maybe a little storage. So a partial floor or catwalk is needed. So obviously fiberglass Batts is an option. I hate dealing with fiberglass install though...What about mineral wool? Rigid foam? Would I see much difference? What about vapor barrier? And should I take the opportunity to add more joists? I need this to be reasonably budget-friendly buts it's a small space so I have some flexibility... thoughts?

New ceiling fan in an older home. Odd outlet box?,9,10,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping to draw on the knowledge of those more experienced than me.

My GF and I just bought our first home in Cleveland. It's an older home (~100yrs), but it's been kept in good condition. That said, every home improvement project we take on seems to run into speed bumps having to do with the age of the home, and the differences in building practices/materials between when it was built and today.

Most recently, I'm trying to install a ceiling fan in our office. It's on the second floor, and it will be replacing an overhead light. The problem is that the old outlet box appears to be of an odd design ([see photo](https://imgur.com/a/mQ4QiBF)) that includes some sort of cross bar going through it from one side to the other. The bar is embedded in the rock-like material of which the ceiling is comprised (I mentioned that we're new to this stuff, right?).

I am taking on the project based primarily on knowledge gained from YouTube, and the assurance of our homeowner friends that this is the sort of thing we can handle ourselves. Have I bitten off more than I can chew? How do I replace that outlet box without tearing apart the ceiling? Is that style of box strong enough to support the ~35lbs required for a moving ceiling fan? Do I need a contractor or something for this?

Thank you in advance for any feedback that you'd be able to provide."

I'm looking to replace the RBC7 battery in it (but not for the price APC wants).

Why insulate between rafters?,3,2," 

Hi all I need some advise on whether it is better to insulate between and under rafters or only under rafters.

I had intended to insulate with 3cm kingspan board between rafters maintaining a 4cm airgap above & 10cm of insulating Kingspan board beneath the rafters.

30 years ago many of the original rafters were reinforced or replaced but there is signs of new rot on the old rafters I am treating all the woodwork with multiple coats of 5 star wood treatment.

I'm thinking it would be easier to combine both boards underneath so 13cm of insulation with fewer gaps/joins and that maximising the air gap between the rafters and the felt would be better?

Any advise appreciated"

Exterior mold,2,3,"So I pulled my exterior siding off of my house about 2 months ago, exposing the studs and lath on the inside of my house. Things got a little crazy and I wasn't able to put the new siding on. Meanwhile, it's summer in Florida so there have been storms aplenty. I know I'm an idiot for leaving my house exposed this long, but I'm ready to put some plywood and Tyvek up this week so I can finally get the siding up. 

Before I seal everything up, what should I do to prevent mold from developing on the inside since it's been exposed to so much moisture at this point? I'm thinking of spraying everything down with mold-killer, and then painting over the studs and lath with fungicidal paint (Zinsser's mold-killing) before I put plywood up. Would this be enough, or are there other treatments you would recommend.

As always, thanks for the help."

LED Strip Lighting Questions,8,28,"Hello. Im kind of an amateur at this. Please go easy on me. I wonder if anyone here will be able to clear some things up and put me on the right track with a project of mine. If there's a more appropriate place to post this, please do tell.

I have a shelving unit that I intend to attach an addressable RGB LED strip controlled by a Arduino UNO. There are 5 shelves, each 1.5m wide. That would be 7.5m in total. I would have to get a 5m (I understand the strips dont come longer than that) and a 3m and splice them together in series. 

Now, Im trying to find out if this would be a bad idea. I understand due to voltage drop the LEDs towards the end could become faded. 

Another option Ive considered is to forgo the bottom shelf and wire two 3 meter strips in parallel (2 shelfs per strip). As much as Id like to, I imagine it would be much more convoluted to wire ALL 5 shelves up in this way.

Now, my second problem is all the different options for powering it. There are 5V or 12V varieties. I wonder why I would choose one over the other. I know I can power the Arduino off either but apparently it can get quite hot running on 12V. 

The strip Im looking at is rated at 9W per meter. So if Ive got this right, for 6 meters Id need either a 15A or 6A transformer for a 5V or 12V transformer, respectively (taking in to account the 20% rule and rounding to the next available type). Alternatively, if I did all 7.5m, 20A or 8A.

Vintage door to table: glass,3,3,"Hey everyone, maybe somebody can help me. I am turning a vintage door into a dining table. The center part has a cut out where there for used to have a window. The glass was single pane and broken when we got the door, but we want glass to cover that part again, however this time it will have to hold its own weight and it should crack under a full Thanksgiving meal either. 
My dilemma lies with figuring out the required thickness of glass. I'm planning to use two layer laminated safety glass, with both layers being safety glass. 
The measurements are
830x1755mm, it's lying on 15mm (+/-1mm) of solid oak on all sides. I guess with a set table for 8 people for a big Turkey dinner it should be able to hold at least 100lbs on top of its own weight. 

Can anybody tell me how thick the glass has to be or point me into the right direction as to how to figure this out? Whatever I've found so far does not take into consideration how much support the glass gets, i.e. whether there's 15mm or 150mm underneath the edges. 

Any help would be appreciated!"

Self leveling concrete for tile,2,18,"Hello So we think we may have made a giant mistake.

Sunroom prepping for porcelain 12x24 tiles. We have the room mapped out all the edges cut for a herringbone pattern, and dry laid it a couple times to be sure with spacers.

Some of the tiles rocked (like 1/10 of them) so we decided to clean the concrete floor, and apply self leveling concrete.

We put down 5 bags of levelquik 50#, at 5.5liters per bag (max recommended water) hoping it would thin it out the most possible!

Only using a squeegee (30"" roughly) on a telescoping pole.. spread it out. Bag after bag, one of us mixing while the other spread, we knocked out all 5 within about 15 minutes or so total.

The result is pretty bad! Hills and valleys pretty noticable, and tiny bubbles everywhere.. And edges of the room go up a little since we couldn't smooth those out very well with the squeegee. Really wish the leveler would have thinned out more. It required much more pulling than we expected even at Max water.

How do we fix this?! Should I sand down the highs with concrete grinders or fill in lows? I can't imagine taking up some 200+sf of solid concrete. Is there a product to add a superfine fill to the whole thing to fill in those valleys?!

Please advise! We realize it should have been thinner and we should've also used a primer probably and had a skree (spelling?) of some sort.. but such is diy..

Help! Faulty assembly of Chop Saw. Any ideas?,5,2,"I got a Chop-Saw, from Evolution

  


Was in the process of putting it together - and basically got to the second step.

  


I misinterpreted the [instructions](https://i.vgy.me/iJGqCQ.jpg) , and inserted the arm through the bevel neck. It seemed a bit tight, bit kept moving. It then got half way - and got stuck. It moves freely back and forth about 8-9mm. I think it found a recess for t lugs to click into.

  


The diagram mentions doing [fig11 and 12](https://i.vgy.me/CYDx2y.jpg) but both of those are while it's out and free

  


I cannot see anyway to access the interior of those tracks where it is sliding

  


And ideas how to get it out/disengage the lugs?

  


[here's the problem](https://i.vgy.me/AQUoEI.jpg) , a [closer ](https://i.vgy.me/NegqPY.jpg)shot

Edit: Update: got one arm through. The locking nut hole in th top, I was able to jiggle and rotate the arm, until I could.see and poke the lug catch. [got one  through](https://i.vgy.me/gfQmwx.jpg)

Next problem, is how to get at the other one, which has no such hole.

The lugs have quite a pronounced [angle](https://i.vgy.me/HFSr0Q.jpg) to them, so just pushing something in seems unlikely

Update2: now that I have it out, I can see both the rebate it got stuck in [here](https://i.vgy.me/nEioXB.jpg) (why is that even there on both sides obviously, if not for the lug), and the mechanism that fits into the arm

Update3: SUCCESS! IVE DONE WHAT AHOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE

Should you come across the post with the same problem - this is what I did:

1) remove black plastic handle from the arms. This allows them to rotate freely, and expose the centre inside

2) the arm on the side of the locking screw, you can remove the screw, rotate the arm, find the lug and push it in with something as per the instructions 

3) for the other one: all I can say is be violent whilst giggling it. I fed a strong knitting needle down through the middle so it was touching the back of the mechanism. I had noticed on the free one when doing this, that it put an angle on the flat topped lug - maybe enough to wedge it out. So I pulled on the arm back out, whilst stabbing in the opposite direction with the knitting needle, and it popped free."

I have a basement toilet that needs to move about a foot, so the toilet wont touch the wall. In the picture linked below, you can see the toilet flange which connects to a 45 degree elbow, which then connects to some kind of fitting, where it connects to the rest of the system.

Im working on building a wall mounted desk and was wondering if all of you think this would hold without legs.

The plan:

- mount 2x4s to the three walls the red lines are touching (approx 2x 8) drilled into each stud along the wall (2 available on each short wall) 
- attach a 2x4 along the front 
- attach 2x4s between the front and back boards (kind of like studs in a wall) to prevent twisting and help distribute weight 
- use 24 x 8 edge glued pine as desk top resting on top of the 2x4 box built in the first 3 steps
- 4x8 aspen board along the face to cover 2x4

Advice on prep to insulate part of a very old airy garage...,3,2,"So we have a large old detached garage from the 40-50s or so, that we use as a shop.  (House is 18??). Its basically the scrap versions of 2x4s with vertical planks on the outside.    (You can see through the gaps.)

In one corner Im building out a small office, with AC.  About 10 x 8.  Which will need good insulation on all sides.  (Weather here is tropical, Texas.)

For insulating the outside walls, I need to improve them to avoid just growing a mold science project once the walls are more sealed...  as it is, rain with some wind behind it will seep in.  But no issue right now as air flows freely through the whole space, and the slab is elevated and in good shape.

I was thinking...

1. Pull the planks off in that area (this is pretty easy)
2. Sheath it in thin-ish plywood, past the office bays
3. Sheath it with a wrap/tyvek
4. Put the old planks back on
5. Insulate the bays inside and proceed as normal

I know there will be some unevenness at the transition where the plywood is added, but its not a big deal given the rustic nature of the whole structure.

Also were planning to demo the whole thing and build a new garage + apt in the next ~5 years... so also not looking to rework the whole thing.

Commercial Glass Door and Window DIY Repair Help,4,0,"Hi, I need help with repairing a commercial glass door and windows in my shop. I will attach pictures to give you an idea of what I am dealing with. The right side large glass door is a bit off kilter, so it does not close in the same plane as the door frame. Something similar happened once with the left side door, but I was able to adjust the ""grip"" of the steel frame on the glass to sort of shimmy it back up. This was possible because the frame itself was straight, just the glass somehow slid too low off the frame. However, this time it seems the entire door has sagged a bit, so even if I adjust the glass, it doesn't do anything. Does anyone have any experience with this kind of door? I don't want to loosen random stuff and have the 200 lbs door fall on me or someone else. How can  I adjust the angle the door sits on?

For the windows, it seems like the gasket is cracked so if I push the window, it feels very loose and possibly dangerous. Can I just silicone caulk it to reinforce it?

Thanks for any help you can give.

[Need Advice] Thoughts on how to remove the rest of this elastomeric paint from a flat roof?,2,3,"[https://imgur.com/a/OfXIvyB](https://imgur.com/a/OfXIvyB)

&#x200B;

I applied this elastomeric paint (several coats) to a flat roof about 6 years ago, water ended up ponding on it and it ended up peeling up to what it looks like now. I should have leveled it or used a different coating.

Underneath is a rubberized roof I believe.

&#x200B;

Removing this by hand and scraper will probably take forever, but is probably the safest way without damaging the rubber. 

I was thinking about renting or buying a pressure washer and using a minimal setting to remove it all.  

My last resort is manually with a scraper and maybe a stiff bristle broom.

After I remove it, I plan on using bitumen or one of the silver paints that can withstand some ponding.

Thoughts on removal?


Edit: barely step on it, need to gently shovel in the winter though when we get abnormal amounts of snow sometimes.

We would like to sit out there once and a while though."

Here is an [Amazon Idea List](http://a.co/hmhLVFW) that has potential components and a good overview of what I'm aiming for.

* There is a battery adapter plate that has 4 slots and one DTAP Output. Assuming that the batteries are wired in series, that is 7.4v x 4 batteries = 29.6v.
* Using a DTAP Splitter to split that up into 4 separate DTAPS.
* Using more DTAP Adapters in the DTAP Splitter to get the output types I want. Such as, 2.5mm DC, USB, etc.

Since camera gear is expensive, I'd hate to over volt any of my gear and dramatically reduce their lifespans. How can I find out if this set up will harm my system or not?

Camera is rated to take 7.4v-9v. Action camera rated 5v via usb.

I tried researching everywhere with very confusing results. Most electrician forums say tolerance of 10% voltage should be fine for most consumer electronic, and others say just plug it in and go. When dealing with this many pieces I just want to make sure I'm not breaking anything. Any help is much appreciated, thanks."

Trying to repurpose old wood fencing. Rookie is stumped on how to remove panels without breaking! Help,0,9,"I've got a bunch of old wood fencing (probably 1/4"" thick panels, dog eared, 5-6 feet tall).  The fencing is already all removed (no posts) and I've got it sitting in my driveway.

It's old and fairly thin/brittle wood, but I'm looking to stain/paint it and use it as a interior wood wall, so it doesn't need to be much more than cosmetic wood.

However, I can't for the life of me figure out a good way to pull the panels off of the support cross boards.  

Any attempting to sort of ""bang"" them off the support ends with split/cracked/damaged panels.  

I checked around a bit online and saw people suggesting a couple other things - but nothing seems to work in my situation.  Someone said a sawz-all to just cut the nails - but they were mostly talking about pallet boards and in my case the nails aren't connected at the ends like they would be in a pallet.

I also saw a more specialized tool someone suggested, but it too seemed intended for pallets and I couldn't see how it'd work for this fencing.

There's only 2 cross support boards..and 2 nails at each intersection foreach panel.

I figured it'd be a bit of a pain and hassle, but I didn't expect to get fully stumped.

How the heck can I re-use this??

Cement board-to-Drywall Transition Help,2,14,"We are remodelling an old basement bathroom and I'm currently working on tiling the corner shower with 3x6 white subway tile.

I've put a little thinset in the gap but need help determining where to put the tile edging: 

1. Before the seam on the cement board and just fill the drywall side with mud and paint it. This uses the tile edging to ""hide"" the difference in depth. 

2. After the seam on the drywall. Here I would have to level off the transition (with thinset and tape?) and then tile over the ""leveled"" seam. 

3. Other option??? 

The shower is 32"" x 32"", and the cement board extends out to 36"". This was suppose to make tiling easy because the width would be 6 tiles across.

Series vs Parallel (peltier TEC),1,5,"Hi!

I have 2 peltier 12v / 15a (I fried my 5a playing with it so bought a higher Amps bunch of these) mounted on a large heatsink and fans to remove excess heat from the heatsink. 
The idea is to make a small incubation chamber from a 70q cooler box (I live in the tropics). I have a 12v, 30a power supply at home. 

If I mount them in series, do I need a 24v 15a power supply vs 12v 30a in parallel?
Are there any other benefits to mount them in series or parallel? 

What happens if I supply less V but adequate Amps to the peltiers? (do they work but at a reduced efficiency? If so: are there formulas to assess the downgrade in performance?)

Last question: what size should the electric cables be? (I assume 30a requires stronger cables than when carrying 15a)

Thanks much!"

What is a better option to fill this Gap between tub and floor?,0,9,"Edit: I think I might try the idea u/SrMalarkey said and see if I can nail straight down to sub floor


[The Gap in Question](https://i.vgy.me/tzdmPa.jpg) this is roughly 5/16"" at it's biggest point.  


I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of people saying I shouldn't be putting laminate floor in a bathroom. But this is the second floor I've done in this house and the first floor not only lasted 11 years, but it was much cheaper than this and didn't have a lifetime warranty with a 24-hour water spill protection on it and it held up just fine. I only changed it because we wanted a different color and higher quality flooring throughout the house.

  


So with that said, the first floor I left about a quarter inch gap between the tub and the flooring and I just caulked it with a silicone-based caulk. when I put this floor in I knew I wanted to reglaze this ugly tub so I left a quarter inch piece of wood in there as a 'gap place holder' but unfortunately I didn't realize until after I move the wood and I set the toilet and everything else that my gap is bigger than a quarter inch. So now I'm kind of stuck with it. So I'm still going to glaze the tub but what is a good solution to fill this Gap other than caulk.  I'm thinking maybe even a combination of caulk and something else? I can't necessarily put base shoe on the tub because I had nothing to nail too.

  


Thanks."

Shower drain replacement help.,0,4,"I am attempting to DIY a bathtub to shower project. I have removed all of the tile, sheetrock and the galvanized metal bathtub and cleaned up the area. I am going to be replacing the tub with a fiberglass shower base like this one: [https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/woodbridge-60-x-32-shower-base-wdbr1130.html](https://www.wayfair.com/furniture/pdp/woodbridge-60-x-32-shower-base-wdbr1130.html)

I have encountered two issues with the drain. 

1. There is a T pipe that looks to be attached to the p-trap that just wont budge (this is the pipe that attached to the bathtub drain and overflow.)
2. The existing drain pipe is about 2"" and the drain that came with the shower pan is 3"".

I have attempted to solve number 1 by turning the ring attaching the pipe but it wont budge, even when I put the adjustable pliers on it. Could I just cut the pipe off (with an angle grinder) and find some kind of flexible rubber 2"" to 3"" tubing (with hose clamps) to connect the drain? The original drain pipe is metal and the drain that came with the shower base is PVC, is there anything wrong with using a PVC drain with metal plumbing? The drain location is approximately correct but may require some minor adjustments to line up perfectly with the shower base."

Help me DIYers How to prevent people from whipping open a sliding glass door.,4,8,"The entrance to my grandmother's house is an old sliding glass door.

\> Similar to this door  [https://www.pellabranch.com/webres/Image/windows-doors/doors/sliding-patio-door.jpg](https://www.pellabranch.com/webres/Image/windows-doors/doors/sliding-patio-door.jpg)  but older.

It has a bottom only track system and predates edgeguards.  These are plastic guards that sit on either side of the wheels on the bottom to prevent them from bouncing off the track. This has never been a problem for her until recently. People have been whipping the door open as fast as they can; this of course leads to the door bumping on something on the track and the wheels fall off the track. This results in the door being very hard to move until one lifts the door and sets the wheels back on the track.

The easy fix to this whole problem I know is to simply install edgeguards on the door. Except this door is exceptionally old & is 70% stained glass (something like this  [http://www.pixball.com/upload/2018/08/27/stained-glass-for-doors-throughout-designs-kmworldblogcom-stained-glass-doors-designs-l-46669894c296a1c7.jpg](http://www.pixball.com/upload/2018/08/27/stained-glass-for-doors-throughout-designs-kmworldblogcom-stained-glass-doors-designs-l-46669894c296a1c7.jpg) ). Frankly I am terrified at the prospect of removing the door to install the guards because it literally cannot be replaced & if the glass is damaged cannot be fixed.

&#x200B;

**So DIYers I need your smarts, madness, and Macgyver skills!**

I need someway to prevent these monsters; honestly who the hell whips open an antique sliding door, from whipping open the door.

I assume some kind of door plunger system might work. Something like a storm door but reversed, so instead of slowing the door closing(slamming shut) it would slow the opening the door.

That said any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated."
Pull a neutral wire from a light switch located directly behind neighboring light switch on wall?,0,8,"Question- my dining room has neutral wires and has a smart dimmer installed.

I need to change a GFCI outlet while the circuit is live.,6,60,"I perform maintenance on a large hotel/casino. In the back of the kitchen there is a break room with a broken GFCI outlet in it. I have flipped every single breaker that I could think of. I also used one of those Breaker Finders where you plug one end into the outlet and then the other part detaches and has a wand that you move along the breakers what will tell you which one. That yielded nothing, except for a whole panel screaming from the reader. I shut the power to that whole panel off and the outlet is still live. The breaker labeled ""recepticles breakroom"" turns off every outlet in there except the one in question. I tried every panel in the building but due to it being a 24/7 casino and restaurant, I can't just turn off the main power. Any ideas on how to do this without electrocuting myself?  It appears this outlet was added in at a later time and inside the box, there are several neutral (white) wires, 2 grounds, 1 hot (black) wire and also a red wire. This is a double outlet box with 2 GFCI outlets in it. Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks.

**EDIT:** Thanks for the replies everyone. Although the ""hire an electrician"" or ""tell your boss no"" answers are very unhelpful in my situation. I will continue to try to find a breaker, however I like my job and OSHA violation or not, this place does not take kindly to refusing work (safe or unsafe). I live in a right to work state and they could always let me go for some ""other reason"".  Worst case scenario, I will have the guy that has been here for 20 years do it since he has more experience than I do."

Advice for painting a rendered brick garden wall,2,4,"Hi all. So, about 10 months ago, my sister had a garden brick wall built that was then rendered by a professional. I was going to paint it before last winter hit, but the weather didn't play ball at the time, one thing led to another, and I never got around to it.

Now, this bank holiday weekend in the UK is looking pretty glorious, and I'd like to soak up some sun whilst getting this job done. My original plan had been to apply a mist coat to the new plaster, and then follow up with a couple of decent coats. Does this sound like a sensible way to go, or does the fact that it's remained unpainted for nearly a year make a difference? Is a mist coat a good idea, and if so, what ratio of paint to water? Or should I be looking for some kind of specialist outdoor primer?

I have a load of white Dulux Weathershield that I'd like to use, but happy to investigate alternatives too.

Tiling help - Patio extension not straight,1,2,"Good afternoon,

I am extending my back patio out 5 meters from the existing structure. I have started to measure up my center line for the tiles to start laying them. I have found that who ever tiles the back patio hasn't done a very straight  job.

If I continue with the current deviation of the tiles I believe that this would be very noticeable when its all done and complete.

I am asking is there is any way to try and correct this with out it looking out of place and without removing the existing tiles.

I have included a drawing of the patio that show what is happening.

[https://i.imgur.com/Ndp64qe.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Ndp64qe.jpg)

Any help would be great.

&#x200B;

Edit: Do I tile on the dotted line? Or do I tile it square from 1930 to 1930 on the center line to the edge of the patio extension?"

How can I identify Dirty Sock Syndrome vs dirty or bad A/C duck work?,15,14,"My master bedroom smells really bad, like strong mildew. It has gotten to the point I don't feel comfortable sleeping in there. It also wasn't cooling much. There was a 3-5 degree difference from the intake to the strongest return vent. We have had the home warranty company send out a group three times now. 

First they cleaned the drain line. On the second visit they added 3lbs of Freon R22 ($210), third they changed the TXV valve because the liquid line started vibrating excessivly in the wall. 

My question is would cleaning the evaporation coil take care of my musty / mildew smell in my Master bedroom? I find it strange that if that is the issue, only one vent smells so strong. I took the vent off and didn't see any mildew at the opening or in the ductwork. The ductwork runs between the second and first floor. 

Additional info: Downstair (approx 1900 sqft) is run on a single unit, but only the Master Bedroom vent has strong mildew smell. The smell is consistantly coming out, not just when the A/C is kicking on or off.

Foam cross head and flag pole mounting.,3,4,"So the crosshead on my door has gotten so beat that it has to be replaced. The wood is just short of dry rot.

And several of the houses in the row, including mine, have 45 degree flag poles mounted to the crossheads. 

I bought a foam crosshead that is really close to the one that is there now, but I feel putting the flag pole back in the same spot on foam wont hold well. 

Id just move the mount elsewhere except the flag would be dangerously close to power lines should the wind blow just right and Ive put a lot of effort into maintaining the federal styling so now Im nit picky about the details and placement. 

Theres room behind the foam to mount a board of some kind, which would then be attached to brick, so I think thats got to happen for the pole to go back up, and my question is..

Should I mount the pole to the foam with the wood back (that is, the mount directly on foam but anchored into the wood that is behind the foam), or maybe cut a hole in the foam and double the wood there for the mount?"
Looking for latching ideas,0,5,"I realize this sounds a little... different, but so far I can't decide on the best option.

I need some advice.

My project is... My wife and I, we need a table in our tiny bedroom. Room is horribly small. I've built a small sideways end table of sorts to attach to the headboard, which is solid 1"" thick hardwood.

For ease of communication, it's basically a wooden box measuring 9"" tall, and 14"" square, with a 1"" thick base that would sit against the headboard and be used to fasten the box to the headboard.

We would use it to sit drinks on, so it must be just as incredibly stable as the headboard to which it's attached. The headboard doesn't move during even the most vigorous of activities. 

I realize that some sort of hardware will be present at all times, but obviously the box would need to be removable. Given that hardware must be present, and we sleep there, the residing hardware would be preferably minimal. I imagine it would need to latch on all four sides in order to ensure its stability. 

Are there any ideas out there?

I'm really hoping you can help us out. I'm not sure if draw/toggle latches would work."

Horizontal studs? Is that a thing?,6,21,"I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.

This is brand new construction apartment complex, only about 1/3 occupied still after a few months being open.

I am getting around to mounting my TV on the wall (an outer wall that the front door is on) and the stud situation has me confused.

I have struggled to find a vertical one even with the power outlet and network outlets in the same area below, which should be easy starting points to find studs. I have a string of finishing nail holes trying to find a vertical stud and only found maybe one.

Are the horizontal detections maybe just me finding the smaller support pieces between them? I have never seen so many used if that is what it is here.

Do I need to affix this to my metal studs?,2,5,"Hi all,  
I just moved from an apartment with wood studs to a newer place with metal studs. 

I am planning to attach this CB2 Acacia Helix desk/bookshelf to my wall tonight: [https://www.cb2.com/helix-96-acacia-desk/s660211](https://www.cb2.com/helix-96-acacia-desk/s660211)

https://i.redd.it/wg4qc9pge1i31.jpg

It has two screws on the top bars, and two screw holes under the desk.

Previously, I attached one of the desk screws into my wood stud, and it didn't move all year. However, when I tried to install it today, I hit a metal stud. My partner says there's no need to affix this to a stud, however I was taught by my father that doom will follow if you do not attach a heavy shelf to a stud. 

So my question is: does this piece of furniture need to be affixed to the metal stud? As you can see from the design of the book shelf, the weight is pretty evenly balanced \*down\*,and supported by the legs standing on the floor, not \*OUT\*, and pulling away from the wall. on the other hand, it will be carrying probably at least 50 lbs of books and stuff. 

Any pointers greatly appreciated! I would love if this only needs drywall anchors."

Newbie question about fixing a leaking shower head.,3,4,"I use a hand shower head (where it rests in a mount and you can remove it and use it clean specific parts of your body). The shower head has started leaking. It isn't the actual shower head itself. Instead, it's where the shower arm attaches to the shower arm mount. When the shower is on, water sprays out from where shower arm and the mount meat. My guess is that a seal or washer needs to be replaced.

What's the best way to check?

Also, and here is where I feel like a complete moron, when working on fixing this problem, do I turn of the water in the shower - using the faucet in the shower that I normally use to turn the shower on and off? Or do I have to shut off the water flow to the bathroom? Or something else? If I have to shut off the water to the bathroom - where would I find the master valve that controls that?

"What type of flooring is reasonably priced, DIY feasible, and not prone to grow mold?",7,15,"Being a good son I moved into my parents house they couldn't sell for the right price, so they could move and live in their retirement house.

Long story short there was mold in the house. Mostly the carpets due to mom's overzealous carpet shampooing. I've ripped the carpets out myself. Had the rest of the house tested for mold, had professionally installed UV filter systems to deal with mold, etc.

As being a good son and fixing this house properly is killing my bank account, what are some flooring options I could possibly do myself, in the rooms that have the carpet ripped out? I see the cork flooring is mold resistant, but I'm guessing any hardwood floor would be. I like how polished concrete looks, but that looks like an expensive rental, and a low success rate of doing it right on my first try. 

Or would hiring someone to re-do the floors into polished/glazed concrete, be comparable to paying for hardwood floors to be installed?"

Without sanding/stripping, is there something I can do to protect the surface? Can I just add a few layers of polyurethane to the top? Everything that I've read talks about stripping/sanding the wood down, then kind of re-starting the entire process of staining and finishing. I don't need to re-stain it, and I don't want to put a different finish on it, I just want to protect it a bit further.

Garage: Leveling the slab and adding a drain,20,4,"My bungalow house (1987, Quebec, Canada) is built on a monolythic slab (no basement) with a 2-car garage attached (24 x 24).  The garage is built on a separate slab 7.5 inches thick. There is a large crack parallel to the street in front with smaller cracks going to the corners of the garage. The garage has settled in the front corners so it now slopes towards the left and right entrance of the garage. I also just had a water softener inside the garage installed and because it needs to evacuate some water every week we just made the pipe run through an old fanhole inside the garage up to one of the agricultural drain outside (no french since there is no basement), so this part is a bit akward. 

The drain would be ideal to park our cars safely during winter and have the water softener pipe installed under the slab. 

I am a bit lost about the process since this is a slab on grade garage and there are cracks in it. A contractor came and said he could jack the garage easily with just 1 pile in each corner, but I did not speak to him about putting a drain. 

What should I do?

Flat Roof Insulation Bridge (advice),3,3,"So I live in New Orleans. Its hot And humid AF. The previous owners built a stupid flat roof and out an a/c pipe (black steel) about 1/4 from the underside of the roof. Its running pretty cool, like 48 degrees and the space is 100+degrees this time of year, so, science occurs and the pipe sweats. I found this out when the ceiling above my bed collapsed...

So I cut the ceiling out. And checked the pipe. Its dripping with sweat. The wrap is all cracked and worthless. 

Head pressure was good, Freon is good. Even better when I gave it a good cleaning. 

  But it all really comes down to the amount of radiation that pipe is getting. Its just science.  It mechanics. 

So my options are to either get a bigger unit and the design the system. Or attempt to shield and insulate that pipe. There is no room above it to put anything meaningful in, so Im going to start but building an insulation bridge for the area over the pipe. A ventilated shield. As well as re-wrapping the thing. (No small task as the pipe  runs through two rooms, only one under the flat roof).

If that doesnt work, Im going to build a sloped aluminum drain channel out to a drain pipe and say screw it. 

Anyone ever deal with this kind of thing? I cant find much in the realm of flat roof insulation bridges. Any advice will be courted.

https://www.lowes.com/pd/TOGGLER-10-Pack-Assorted-Length-x-3-16-in-Dia-Toggle-Bolt-Drywall-Anchor-Screws-Included/3183815


Measurement wise my dry wall is about an 1in thick, with the clearance approximently 1-5/8 in. 
The toggle bolts above require a minimum of 1-7/8 in.

I am considering using these however these are screwed in and I wouldnt know how I would get past by the initial metal stud https://www.lowes.com/pd/E-Z-Ancor-2-Pack-2-1-2-in-x-5-8-in-Dia-Standard-Drywall-Anchor-Screws-Included/1119021

I am hesitant to use others anchors such as these as I worry about the strength and again issuss with getting past intial metal stud.
https://www.lowes.com/pd/TOGGLER-Snapskru-20-Pack-1-5-8-in-x-3-8-in-Dia-Standard-Drywall-Anchor-Screws-Included/3183255
 

Anyone have suggestions on what to use?

I am already in the process of buying a lighter mount to anticipate further issues with anchoring.

Total weight of mount + TV is a little under 45lbs.


Edit: So I actually took a boroscope to take a look back, looks like I was hitting another metal stud, the stud is ""C"" shaped with the left metal and right side empty. 

Would it be a problem drilling through both studs and putting a toggle bolt through each even with the empty space in between?"

Ceiling fan light replacement -- What on earth is this?,3,13,"A while back, I had a problem with the ceiling fan light in my office. I tried to unscrew the bulb to replace it, but the bulb's thread stuck inside the socket, like it was glued in there. I wasn't able to remove the threading no matter what I did, so I decided to replace the light kit instead.

I bought a replacement universal light kit from Lowe's that looks like this:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/3mu6l69z8wh31.jpg

It has screw holes on the top and sides to screw into the light switch housing. The problem is that my ceiling fan doesn't seem to have that. It just has a cardboard wafer, and above that is a mess of wires. Nothing to attach the new light kit to.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mkvv6l109wh31.jpg

Am I boned here? The previous owner cheaped out on every little thing, so I'm guessing this was some bargain basement fan that isn't compatible with any other light kits. Am I going to need to replace the entire fan?"

AC unit not blowing cold air,1,15,"So I came home after work and noticed my house was a bit warmer than usual. Vents are blowing, but just warm air, so I assume it has something to do with outside unit. After doing some research, I went outside to inspect outside unit and noticed a buzzing but fan is not turning. I'm able to kickstart fan so I'm assuming the capacitor is bad, however even after kickstarting capacitor, the vents are still blowing only warm air.

I have a trailer hitch grill that I made out of some aluminum square posts; a vice grip plate, and a smaller grill.

My main reason for posting in here is share my progression and also ask a question about a new modification I am preparing to make. 

Currently it sticks out rather far from the back of the truck, maybe 3-4 feet and while I was messing around with my toolbox I had the brilliant idea of putting the square tubing onto a heavy duty drawer slider, I was wondering if anyone had any recommendations that might benefit me in this search? Right now I have googled ""heavy duty draw sliders"" and ""heavy duty sliding rails"". Is there any other terminology that I might be not thinking about?

Shed foundation,5,12,"I am struggling what foundation to use for an 8x10 shed I plan to build. I live in the Northeast US so our frost line is 48. The shed I plan to build is: https://www.icreatables.com/sheds/8x10-TVD-dormer-shed-plans

I have done lots of reading and YouTubing but I cant seem to decide on the best foundation. I am leaning toward either poured concrete piers or a gravel pad with precast piers on top of the gravel.  The area the shed is being built on has recently been cleared of trees and brush and is pretty flat.

Which of these would be the preferred method (or are there better options)? The thing I just cant seem to grasp for the poured piers is how to level and align the brackets that would be set into the poured concrete piers that the beams would be fastened to.  It seems like that would be really easy to mess up and you really only get one shot. On the other hand, Im a little worried about frost heaves if I use the gravel and precast piers.  Thoughts?"

Raised platform bed technicals,1,2,"Hi all,

I've been looking around the internet for a definitive answer on how to best build my project. 

A bit of backstory. We have a bedroom 2,70x5,65 (that's in meters :) that has a queen sized bed 1,60x2,00 in it that's rarely used s it's a guest room/kid room. Kid had grown up and needs a proper bed and desk. I was thinking of creating a raised platform to hide the bed underneath and ""create"" a new space for the kid. 

Question is the following which material would be best to build the platform to keep it as slim as possible. Not to have a massive block in the room. 

Was thinking of using the front of the drawer as a library for kids books. 

Height should be around 50 cm (three steps max)

So wood work ? Metal work ? Am a newbie in both so I guess same learning curve :)

Need advice on Patio Door,1,3,"I have a large patio door [96 x80] in my breezeway that has seen too many years I think. It is hard to open and both the fixed and the sliding glass door are misted up pretty badly.

I called the local high end window and door place and they said a repair would cost me 2k but they don't do it   ...so I am not sure he was just making that up to discourage repair.

He suggested a new door for between 3 and 4k. That's just out of my budget..


It seems to be a bit much. I have seen some at HD for 1500 and they say they install for 3-400. Not sure of their quality. 


I know I can remove the door and get new rollers for the sliding issues, but not sure what to do about the misting.  I have replaced windows around the house but this seems a bit out of my league. Any thoughts welcome."

Hanging things on old plaster walls (or drywall)?,3,3,"Hello--hoping to get some definitive answers to my ongoing wall saga. I've been in my rental for about 7 years now, and have tried and failed multiple times throughout the years to get things hung on the walls.

I never put much thought into this, and just assumed my walls were made of drywall, but I recently came to the realization that I may have plaster walls due to the following:

* old NYC apartment built in 1910--based on my own sleuthing of property records, I don't think the units were ever converted/resized, so I believe the walls are original.
* past efforts to get screws into walls ended up in a crumbly mess and/or screws just spinning in place; holes usually end up bigger than the screws. I've tried regular screws and those plastic anchor ones, and unless there's a stud, neither holds. I've tried sticking in a thumbtack before--the wall is definitely too hard to do that by hand alone.
* walls are uneven and bumpy/lumpy (though this could also just be layers of layers of paint throughout the decades), and there's a small, thin crack in one spot (again, could just be cracked paint?)
* anyone remember making those rain sticks in grade school, where you put rice in the tube to make the sound? If I bang on the wall really hard, that's kind of what it sounds like back there. I think it's old, crumbly plaster loosening and falling.
* my walls don't sound super hollow, though there is some hollowness when tapped. I can hear neighbors' muffled conversation vs. being able to make out word for word.

Based on the description above, can anyone confirm this sounds like plaster, rather than any other material?

Then knowing that my walls are plaster and not in the best shape, is there still hope for me to hang things? I live in a studio with super high ceilings, so I'd like to be able to maximize storage. Specifically by adding more shelves and possibly mounting the tv screen. So I think max. weight would be about 50-75 lbs.

Are toggle bolts perhaps the answer?

Thanks in advance!"

how to install lighting junction box when i can't reach,1,10,"Recently I wanted to change the bulbs in a fixture near my front door. I removed the glass dome and got the bulbs out but the entire fixture was loose, so I unscrewed it and looked and the blue plastic junction box has cracked in half and hanging on for dear life. This seemed dangerous, not to mention that the lights would flicker a lot because the fixture wasn't secured tightly, so I removed the old junction box. That was easy I just ripped it apart and took the two nails out of a stud. My issue is that I want to replace it, however the hole in the ceiling around the junction box is no where near large enough for me to be able to hammer the new box in to the studs. I've looked at the type of junction box with ""wings"" that open and are just supported by the ceiling, but  there isn't enough room for the wings to open because they run in to to the stud. Does someone have an easy answer for how to get a junction box installed in a tiny hole (basically the size of the round box, of do I need to cut a larger hole in the ceiling to be able to reach and use a hammer?

Thanks,

This means that instead of my 3-ply 2x8 beam having offset 16' boards spanning the 32' length of the deck, I now have to splice beams in odd locations. I don't know much about this at all.

If it helps, the deck is only 1' to 2' off the ground max (sloped yard).

[In this diagram I have 3 options I've come up with.](https://imgur.com/a/QtHqtpE)

* A - I splice every single beam segment over a post. This seems the most stable against shear force but I have read in a few places online that this isn't ideal because you've got lateral weakness since the splice is through every board.

* B - I vary where my splices are. The middle segment of beam splices over posts, the sides splice over the span but are offset. I don't like the idea of having a splice mid-span.

* C - Inner section spans two posts, splice is in the last quarter of the middle span. Outer sections splice over posts. I'm leaning toward this but open to other suggestions.

In the diagram I try to show the layering of the beam such that the middle segment would be in the middle of the 3-ply beam. 

When I look this up online I get multiple answers and I can't seem to find anything concrete. I see DIY videos on YouTube of people splicing beams any which way, and on other sites I see warnings never to splice anywhere except over a beam, still other sites say not to splice all boards in a beam over a post. Then I'll find some other site that says you *can* splice off a beam. I'm... confused - and I've never built something like this before.

This would be so much easier if the footings were in the right place but here I am. Any advice is greatly appreciated."

Building a large deck and need some advice on the Piers,3,6,"Hello all,This may be a silly question, however here's the lowdown. Im building a rather large deck, the architect spec'd out around (20) 10"" piers. However he made a note to use a ""Bell footing"" This seems like a great idea, except when you know what it takes to dig 20+, 30"" square holes 48"" deep. I emailed him back asking if we could just use 10"" sonotube, no bell footings and he said ""Yes"" now, I was hoping for this answer, but now im about to drill and getting worried that its a bad idea. However If some areas settle i can jack and replace the supports or shim, but....

Anyone with some input? Here are some details...

Deck is approx 14' deep x 40' across and elevation is approx 36""."

Basement door installation question,0,5,"Hi there, 

I live in the northeast US - most homes here have basements and a bulkhead to get down in. 

I want to install a pre-hung door in the basement leading to bulkhead to help keep the cold air out in winter. Ive installed doors before but never on concrete. 

My question is, should i put a piece of pressure treated wood on the floor and the door on top of that or should I rest the door on the floor?

"Reclaimed barnwood table refinish: best approach for filling cracks, holes, and seams in tabletop",5,6,"[I picked up a reclaimed barn wood table](https://imgur.com/gallery/EDJMYat) that I am in the process of refinishing.  I've sanded it down and I am preparing to do some repair prior to staining the top a dark color (either walnut or espresso).  I love the character of the dings, holes, and seams in the wood HOWEVER I have young children who will be eating off this table and who I know will relish shoving food down into any cracks so this table needs to be hygiene-proofed.

[There are a couple of damaged areas](https://i.imgur.com/TLsRxfc.jpg) where I will replace boards, however, there are still a lot of old nail holes, seams between boards, and general ""character"" just begging to be filled with applesauce and mac'n'cheese. I'm considering a couple of approaches to filling all these so that it the table is easy to clean and I was hoping to get some guidance on which is the best:

- the first approach is to simply use a stainable wood filler and then stain and put a polyurethane coating on top.  It looks like this table was originally made this way [as I can see some sort of old filler in some seams](https://i.imgur.com/dqlDMvT.jpg).  If this is the best route, can you recommend a product?  It's been a few years since I used a stainable wood filler but it didn't look *great* when I used it... the filler absorbed the stain differently from the wood and looked very artificial.  I am particularly concerned about the appearance of the seams if I go this route.

- the second approach would be to seal the holes from the bottom of the tabletop, maybe use some wood filler here and there, and then to epoxy the table top.  My thoughts are that the clear epoxy would settle into the seams and holes allowing us to see that texture, but be sealed off from the gross kids.  My concern here is that it will look to ""plastic""

Thoughts?  Alternative approaches?

Thanks in advance!"

Air conditioner help,2,12,"Hope this is a good place to post this.

We have a 1993 Bryant AC unit. 

For the past 3 or 4 years, this thing acts weird. Like, when it is in the 70s and low 80s, the thing works fine. Our house is cool. But when it gets hot, like in the 90s and low 100s, I don't think the thing works with a shit. The house is always hot. You can barely feel anything coming from vents. It takes like 3 hours to lower the temp 1 degree or whatever.

Almost every year we call somebody in for a maintenance check. filling up the freon, recharging, etc...Just had one last night. He said everything looks good. Doesn't know why it doesn't work well in high heat. 

In my mind, which doesn't mean much, i'm thinking because it is 26 years old it just works really hard and can't keep up in the heat. Plus, it isn't energy efficient, etc...  Now, my batshit crazy MIL says that the age of an AC unit doesn't mean anything. Her AC unit is from the 70s and it still works perfectly. Never been checked and never recharged...I don't believe her. but whatever. I think age does have something to do with air units.

Any other ideas on what could be causing this and what could help? Obviously, buying a brand new AC would help...but yeah.

Thanks."

Need Help Diagnosing Hot Water from Cold Tap,2,16,"Before I get into it with the warranty department at Rheem, I just want to make sure I'm not missing something. For the last week or so, warm to hot water has been coming through the cold taps in my house. It's intermittent... sometimes it is as cold as normal, other times it runs warm for a while then turns cooler. 

I'm pretty sure it's an issue with the water heater, which is just under a year old and has been working fine until now. I know it isn't an issue with the taps, since it's happening at every sink, toilet, shower, etc. I checked the external tap that is located between our main water line and the water heater, and it seems to be normal temp, while the tap closest to the water heater is running warm. I even lowered the temp of the water heater to see what difference it might make. It's somewhat cooler, but still running warmer than normal. 

So... is there anything else I should try? The only thing I haven't done is hit the reset button on the water heater, but I don't know if that would make a difference at this point. 

Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide."

A type of post footing for modular bar structure?,3,6,"I want to make a callisthenics bar structure in my garden. But it needs to be removable. I want four wooden posts, ideally 4x4 inch ones in a square which I'll pass scaffold bars through.

Problem being the only post holders I can find are for posts to permanently sit in. Ideally I want a square tube that's 3ft long I can drop the posts into and lift them out again. Even better with contours on the outside that'll grip when set in concrete.

I could do the whole lot with scaffolding... But it won't look as nice. Would last longer and be more modular... But ignoring that obviously superior option...

Any ideas?"

Bifold Doors in Odd Opening,1,5,"I'm trying to install a set of bifold doors in a semi-finished basement and I'm struggling with a couple of issues. The opening for the doors was framed and finished by the previous owner, and they purchased these bifold doors and left them in the house when they moved out. Fast forward to today and I'm trying to install them and having a hell of a time. For one, the frame is just not the right size for these doors. Too tall and too wide. If I was smart, I would've laid out the whole arrangement and tested for rough fit but I am not smart. I ""took care of"" the too tall issue by adding a 2x4 below the header and painting to match. Ok, not a big deal. The width is another issue. How do I cleanly add width? On top of that, I'm learning now that the opening is not square. Namely, the header is off level. You can see it in the picture, top right. Sides seem to be fairly plumb. So my question is, what is the best/least-noticeable way to fill the width and hide the uneven header? If you can't tell, I really don't want to have to buy new doors bc I'm cheap, if I could even find some that fit. I'm thinking about adding some thin strips to the inside of each door and sanding until hidden, and maybe putting another trim piece over my 2x4 to hide the top gap some? Thoughts?

Questions on wooden deck balusters.,16,11,"Hi all, first time poster here. I'm a fairly experienced DIYer, but I'm puzzled with this problem. I'm looking to replace my awful deck railing. I'm planning on something like [this](https://mobileimages.lowes.com/product/converted/099796/099796801700_08028412.jpg), but I have a few concerns. 

First off, how on earth do you secure the balusters to the rail. It would be easy enough to just run a screw in the bottom because it's basically hidden, but I don't want to do the same thing for the top. I could put screws in the sides of the baluster, but again I'm not sure I'll like how that looks at all.

Secondly, I'd like to get my hands on non-pressure treated balusters. From what I understand I'd have to wait at least a year to paint them and while I could do that, I would much rather paint them before actually putting the railing together. I can get everything painted on a set of saw horses in a much more efficient manner.

Any and all advice is appreciated."

Need help diagnosing the level of screwed up for some outlets in my basement,1,10,"Hey Reddit! Bought a home a few weeks ago and I'm working on some projects to get things up and running.

When we did the home inspection, one of the outlets in the basement was reversed-polarity. The home inspector noted that in his report.

However, when we moved in, that outlet is just simply dead. On top of that, another outlet closest to it is also dead (though on a different wall). When I put in a plug tester I don't get anything anymore. I'm not sure if they tried and failed to fix it, or what is going on there.

I decided to investigate the little that I know how to. I shut off all the power, and unscrewed the face plate, and pulled the outlet out to double check the wires. Everything seemed fine to me... no loose connections or anything.

I turned the power back on, and tested the wires (still attached to the outlet if that matters) with a non-contact sensor, but received no signal. I busted out the multi-meter and tested them (after watching a Youtube video to be sure I was touching the exact right thing to the exact right place), and received no reading at all. I tested it by touching the multimeter terminals to the screws where the wires were connected.

The outlets that aren't working are closest to the southwest corner of the house (which is an outer all), one on the south wall, and one on the west wall. The outlet I checked with the multi-meter is the one on the south wall. However, the next outlet on the south wall (a bit further east) is working. The west wall outlet is the only one over there, but everything on the north wall is working fine. The breaker is north of this room as well if that matters.

Given that the wires are dead, what should I do? Is this a specific terminal issue, or am I going to have to try and run new wiring? What would my next troubleshooting steps be?"

Adding a gate to front porch w/vinyl siding,1,2,"Would like to put a gate on the front porch where one side is wood and the other side is the house w/vinyl siding.   
Instead of putting it directly up against the house, was considering using a 4x4 post using this type of base. I can't seem to locate one with four sides and was considering getting two and setting them atop each other in opposite directions. 

My reason for not installing against the siding and into the house is that it's a rental and while I have permission to install the gate, it must be removable when I move out and not leave any more work to be done. The space right now is 53"" and with a 4x4 I figured I could get a 48"" prefab gate.

French Drain Help/Opions,4,3,"Here is a picture of my yard:

[https://imgur.com/V45lpc5](https://imgur.com/V45lpc5)

I am installing a french drain because all alone A-B and B-C is constantly soggy/flooded from my neighbors and my rain run off. I already tried to add to slope it a bit, but there isn't much I can do. I also have a fence along all of this.

My problem is from B-C my yard (and neighbors) are supposed to exit into a swale in the the back that runs to a county drain. The problem is that it is barely 1% slop from B (the corner of my yard) to C (the start of the drain). If I put in a french drain then I would basically need to have it be a shallow as possible and then I am only going to get .5% slope to the BOTTOM of the swale that is supposed to take water away from my house.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure there is anything I can do here. I actually have a 12"" Deep x 14"" Wide trench dug along C-B and A-B, but when I checked the actual slope if I were to just put in a french drain along the bottom (fabric/stone/etc) it led me to believe it would just fill up with water and sit in my french drain. 

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any thoughts? Should I still run the deep drain or try to slope it. 

&#x200B;

The only options I think I have is: 

&#x200B;

1) Very shallow drain where I keep the slope as best I can

2) Keep it deep, stop short of the swale, switch to drain pipe to hopefully flow it into the swale

3) Keep it deep and add a dry well in my yard (I don't want to do this)

4) Build a retaining wall essentially to prevent the water from flowing from swale into my yard, have the french drain dump into it, and pump the excess water up back into the swale.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\*No I cannot dig the swale deeper in the back it is part of a county drain and I am not supposed to be digging in it."

Strange plaster repair UK,4,10,"
My partner and I bought our first house last year and are slowly redecorating and getting jobs done.

I was stripping wall paper in the living room and made note of a couple of patches that need repairing as I was going, when I came across this: 

https://imgur.com/a/We3MZMP

It's an old repair that is failing. I initially thought it was a repair to some chasing for the light switch for 2 spot lights. But it's basically thin sheet wood with steel mesh over it. 

I'm in the UK and in my limited knowledge it's not normal to repair chasing in this way. 

I've not had a chance to fully uncover it as it will involve breaking through the wood and I didn't want to start creating a bigger job whilst it was starting to get dark.

Any thoughts on what it could be? Just a creative repair for something?"

Portable air conditioner shows negative room temperature and won't cool,3,9,"I have a portable air conditioner that I bought second hand. It was supposedly only used four times, and should work. It worked OK for a bit, but now I have this weird problem. This is the unit: https://www.malmbergs.com/Products/9987024

The unit shows negative room temperature. Specifically it shows -9c. If I move it just a bit, it can change and become erratic, before settling on another temperature. Most often it settles on -9 though.

Earlier I got it to start by moving it slightly. Suddenly it would show the correct room temperature, and start the compressor. This has become harder and harder to do. I can't seem to find the sweet spot anymore.

Another thing worth mentioning is that moving it around can also provoke the code E2 in the display. I don't know what it means, and have contacted the manufacturer which also doesn't know.

I am suspecting a faulty ambient room temperature sensor. The only problem with that theory is that actually moving the sensor that sticks out on the back over the coils does nothing. I can clip it completely off and move it around, but the temperature does not change.

Only moving the unit itself helps. I want to open it and see if something has happened with the plug or something, but I have never done anything like that before. I have asked the manufacturer if they have replacement sensors. They do not.

The best thing would be to find what actual manufacturer, probably in China, makes these. They must have some replacement sensors, no?

Any tips to get this unit to cool the room again would be highly appreciated!"

Switch(es?) blowing AFCI breaker,0,13,"[bathroom electric](https://imgur.com/gallery/JeNEblf)

So I need some help (again) with an electrical issue. 
 
I wired the basement and due to some new building code all the breakers are AFCI (which I am suspecting is a part of the problem).  In the bathroom there 3 light switches, labeled 1,2 & 3 on image, switch 1 directs to a pot light and an led light, switch 2 goes to a vanity light and 3 is a fan.
 
For months we havent been able to use switch 1 because it will trip the breaker, not always immediately, but usually within 30 seconds.  I spent all week trying to solve it, I went into the device box and cleaned up the wires for the switches as best I could making sure nothing was exposed, I replaced the switch (from another one in the basement so I knew it worked).  This all improved the issue slightly, in that it took a while longer to trip. 
 
We kept thinking we had solved it and then short time later it would trip again, here is where it gets weird we discovered an almost surefire way to make it trip was to have both light switches on (1 & 2) and then turn off switch 2 (ie the one that hasnt been a problem); switch 2 being turned off would kill the breaker as long as switch 1 was on.  I pulled out all the lights tested different combination of wiring, such as one light being bypassed or cut off and this more or less holds true. Except now I find it takes the light a few minutes to heat up or whatever before turning off 2, while 1 is on, will trip the breaker.
 
Anyways there is not a lot of load on the circuit, a tv and SMALL deepfreeze and two lights that are rarely on (pantry).

Also I could just swap out the afci break for a regular since the inspector has come and gone"

Horizontal Drain on Wall Mount Toilet,2,6,"I'm looking to install a wall mounted toilet in my basement, but noticed all the steel fixtures are designed with a [vertical drop](https://i.imgur.com/A2scCjw.jpg) for the drain. This makes sense in most cases, but the location of where my vertical drain is, not so much for me.

[Here is a general set up of what I plan to do](https://i.imgur.com/HBVd6bE.jpg)

[And here is a general setup of how I plan to pipe it in](https://i.imgur.com/IqZ03qy.jpg)

I plan on installing the 4x4x4x2x2 sanitary tee with a 4""  internal pipe extender, so that I don't need to break up the concrete. This should make the center of the sanitary tee drain roughly 8""-8.5"" off the ground.

The rough-in for the wall mount toilet can be 5""-10"" from the finished floor, depending on how high you personally want it. I plan on having it about 9"" from the floor, giving me 0.5""-1.0"" of elevation drop for about 1.5' to 2.0' of piping from the toilet to the drain, giving me a worst case of 0.25"" per foot, which is fine.

First question is: Has anyone ever installed [one of these wall mounted frames](https://i.imgur.com/A2scCjw.jpg) with a horizontal drain connected to the main stack? I can't see why this would be an issue, but can't seem to find much information on this type of setup.

Second question is: Does my plumbing look alright? I'm installing a cheater valve because each floor requires its own tie-in to a venting system, even if I'm tied-in to the floor above venting. Instead of digging into my drywall, a cheater should work fine, I believe. They are good for code in my area, and I will be able to access it no problem if it ever fails and needs replacing.

Thanks in advance!"

How to anchor a new wardrobe,0,10,"I just built a new Ikea wardrobe, all is great. However the instructions call for the top to be anchored to the wall.

The wall in question is drywall over masonry. I have gotten through the drywall, there's approximately 1cm gap between the drywall and masonry behind it. The anchors are just simple L shaped anchors like this:

https://www.amazon.ae/Anti-Tip-Safety-Bracket-Shaped-Anchor/dp/B07N68P72G

The question is, given a standard plug doesn't seem to fit and comes out fairly easily, what can I use to anchor it to the wall? I doubt there will ever be much foward force on it and empty the likelihood of it tipping is quite low. But rather be a little safer than sorry."

Repairing a concrete walkway - Guidance needed (with pictures),11,4,"Hi everyone,

The objective of my post is to have guidance on how to repair properly a concrete walkaway, and see if it is a possible DIY project. I am a beginner but have access to help.

The actual situation is that there is one major crack and other hairline cracks. 
It seems to have sunked a bit. Based on comments of past owners, it seems the settling is done and the major crack has not enlarged for several years. It is almost non unleveled. The walkway thickness is approximately 2 inches.

I live in Quebec, Canada with important temperature changes (from -40 to +40 degrees celcius).

Pictures here: https://imgur.com/gallery/FZLJmfm

My questions are;

- Step #1: Do you believe it needs to be leveled/ jacked before? If yes, what are my options. I have read about mud jacking is quite easy but may not last long. I have read also about polyeurethane injections. Can this 2nd option absolutely requires a professional?

- Step #2: What is the optimal way to repair it? I would like to give it a fresh new look by filling the cracks and putting a new layer of concrete on top.

Thank you very much,"

I'm taking the steering wheel to replace a broken ignition lock but these two screw are designed ""to make it impossible"". (Other than that there is a T55 screw, I don't have any bit for it and local store don't sell upward of T50.)

I tried a cordless screwdriver but obviously it failed, I initially though it was rusted head instead these things doesn't have a head anymore.

I have a cordless dremel but not the bit to drill into metal. The dremel is able (by the manual) to do 25,000 RPM.
Should I buy the bit for the dremel or use a corded drill, something I would like to use as a last resort because the extension cords would have to go from a friend house through the parking lot.

Oven stops working sporadically,3,3,"I have an IGS385RS (Ikea/Whirlpool) gas oven.  It works most of the time.  Occasionally, especially after several hours of cooking, it will exhibit the following symptoms.  The ""heat"" indicator on the control panel will be lit, meaning it thinks it's raising the temperature - but the flame will remain off.  The oven temp will begin to fall until it's at room temperature.  Here's what I've done so far:

1. Replaced the bake ignitor (no change)
2. Tested the temperature probe.  At room temperature, there it has the correct resistance (1089 ohms).

Any ideas what could be wrong?  Should I (gasp) call in an oven repair person?  Will they be able to diagnose if it's sporadic?  Unless there is an obvious fix for this that will have a high probability of working, I'm probably not willing to buy parts (control board, spark module, etc) that are in the $200 range but might not work - especially because a brand new oven is around $600."
How do I remove rotten deck posts? They are not the easy kind.,16,37,"I have 4x4 deck posts that are rotting at ground level.

"Area of paint in the bathroom always flakes away, how can i best protect?",3,10,"There is a an area of wall in my bathroom that always has the paint flake away. This wall is shared with the outside of the house. The other walls do not have this problem.

You can see from the photos that the flaking only really happens in this little strip, although, i could not tell if there is also damage under the cladding however there is very little spread of the rot up the wall further. 

I suspect the cause of the problem is due to moisture however leaving the extractor fan, and window open does little to control it. In the past I have addressed the problem simply by sanding and painting. 

I suspect there is underlying issues however i cannot address them at this stage. Im hoping someone could give me some guidance on how i can best protect against this rot, is there any way i can prepare the area in a way that can resist this?

Some outlets/lights on circuit not functioning after replacing outlets,4,5,"Finally got around to replacing the 6 outlets in my final two bedrooms today, and ran into some issues (prior to this, had done all other outlets on this level with no issue over the last few months).

So, I replaced the outlets, and went to turn the breaker back on. Was greeted by an immediate short and the breaker tripping. Went back up, double checked that I hadn't left any loose wires on the new outlets and tried a few more times, each time with the same result.

Finally a friend mentioned that I might be getting a 240v short if I hadn't removed the bridging tab (this house has a mixture of [2 wire](https://imgur.com/YH41fdu) and [4 wire](https://imgur.com/t4jxtFh) outlet wiring. 

This sounded promising, so I went and snapped all the tabs off on the 4 wire outlets and was able to turn the breaker back on. This particular breaker has the garage, the bedrooms (outlets and lights), and a couple outlets from the basement on it (It's a tuck under style garage, so the bedrooms are right over the garage).

The garage door opener powered on, and our internet was working (the cable connection uses one of the outlets in those back bedrooms), so I assumed everything was working and went to run a couple more errands.

However, got back home and realized that those two things (the one outlet and the garage door opener) were the *only* functioning things on that circuit.

Double checked all other breakers and everything looks good. About ready to try and get an electrician out here, but figured I'd post here first in case there's some simple fix like there was for my first dumb mistake.

Thanks!

EDIT: Been doing more research online, read that it could be a tripped GCFI. There is a single GCFI outlet in the garage, but that appears to have no power to it. Checked all other GCFIs in the house and they all appeared correct.

EDIT 2: Went and checked all the _old_ outlets (had to dig them out of the trash, which was gross), and they all seem to have actually had the tab? Soooo.... Now I'm confused.

Final edit: Well, I replaced all the outlets with more new ones, this time keeping the tabs on. Flipped the breaker and everything works. So, I guess the world will never know, but I'm glad to have power to everything again."

Hi everyone,

One of the two screws holding my smartphone together is stripped and I need to open the phone in order to repair it. Since it's a very small screw, puting a rubber band over it doesn't do the trick, because the screwdriver just pokes through the rubber band. I also tried putting a little bit of superglue on top of the screw, but that didn't work either.

It looks like this: [https://i.imgur.com/cASNX69.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/cASNX69.jpg)

How would you fix the issues on this wall?,1,1,

Feeling like an archaeologist - making sense of different wall layers when prepping for paint,46,11,"I've been stripping the woodchip wallpaper off a 1930 era UK property with the plan to paint the room. Pretty new to DIY but trying to do as much research before each step and hoping to share a little progress here and get advice along the way. 

On one wall, the paper came off relatively easily with a steamer and revealed a solid grey wall which I presume is plaster... it has a a crack going down it but planning on filling that then sanding. Is the length of this crack anything to worry about? 

This wall gave me false hope for how easy the job would be as the next wall has been a real pain. This wall is plasterboard and has many layers to it. There are two solid white plaster pillars which I believe are the electrical chases. The rest appears to be standard plasterboard with the dark brown paper type surface. I'm doing my best to not chip into this along the way whilst removing the paper but it has happened a fair few times already. 

In order to prepare this second wall for painting would I need to get it down to the dark brown layer, fill cracks then sand the whole wall down to a smooth finish? 

I'm also unsure whether the painting approach to both walls should be the same or if the wall with plasterboard may require lining paper too. If it needs lining paper I may need to get the pros in... 

Thanks in advance for any pointers.

Where is this water coming in from?,1,6,"We finally gutted the basement where I thought we had mold. Well we did. http://imgur.com/gallery/sf7STrD 

I don't know where it's coming from exactly. You can look at my post history for more photos. We have a 7 year concrete slab in this section outside with not the greatest slope. Caulked around the house with sikaflex and I haven't seen an actual leak since then. I'll call the window guy tomorrow. For now I just want to figure out where the water has been coming in from. I suspect it started to happen when they poured the concrete because the section of the house with gravol has no leak, but it also has Windows above grade. It's a back split with a 2 level basement. Please help me figure this out. 

Just to add, the gutters drain on the other side of the house in the front. There is a backyard French drain and it starts along the edge of the slab."

HELP: Fireplace Brick Repair,8,6,"In the process of removing some very old (and very stuck on) tile from the face of the chimney, we ended up losing the faces of some brick. None of the bricks are cracked, they're just missing 1-2mm from the surface of the brick. Is this purely cosmetic damage? We're trying to figure out the best path forward and so far it seems like our options are:

1. Leave it, paint over it, deal with it being uneven in some places.
2. Attempt to repair the faces w/ some form of concrete/mortar.
3. Re-tile over it.
4. Have a mason come out and repair/replace the bricks.

We plan on painting the brick, so if the solution involved somehow patching the brick faces, matching the color wouldn't be something we'd need to worry about.

LVP glue removal over concrete for laminate installation,3,1,"Im getting ready to remove some glue down lvp and install 12mm laminate with underlayment in its place. Im removing the lvp because the other half of the floor has carpet, so I want to go back to all concrete and then put down the laminate. The lvp has only been in place for about two years. It pulls back up pretty easy and the glue below is still tacky and thin, no ridges or puddles. My question is do I need to try and remove all this glue prior to putting down the underlayment? Its sentinel brand underlayment, basically like a foam. Im thinking the tackiness would just help hold the underlayment in place, but Im not sure if the glue would have any chemical reaction with the foam and break it down in any way. Or if theres any other reason I cant just put it straight over the glue. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!"

Need some help getting started with laying a hardwood floor,14,12,"I could use a little advice on what is the best way to start laying an engineered hardwood floor.   I've recently purchased a house and while they put new flooring  on the first floor and stairs, the upstairs was carpeted.  This is a tounge and groove flooring that I will be nailing down.

I have a couple of questions.    

1)  What is the best way to start on the second floor?   I know the general advice is to find the longest exterior wall and start off it.  However, in this case I have 1 strip of flooring around the perimeter of the stairs.   Does it make more sense in this case to start my rows against what is already there?  If so, any suggestions on where?  I have attached a pic of the stairs.  Would I just butt up against it and face nail?

2)   I've laid floating floors and handled levelling the slab.   How does this work with a nail down floor?  I do have a couple of spots where the plywood sheets aren't perfectly flat.   I could sand down the ridge.  Do people use self leveling compound on the wood floors?   If so - how would you nail into that?

Thanks for you suggestions!

Gravel/sand to even out flooring for a floating floor.,3,4,"So I came up with a what I think is a unique concept to put down sand or finer gravel, instead of self leveling mix. Its liquid and uncontrollable for a large part it seems...

I figured you just set it all down and it will naturally fill in everything then you just refine till your level. Set down the padding, as it should be accounted for in measuring. 
Then the floating lock-in flooring. 

I just dont think it would be necessary for cement leveler."

Locating source of stray voltage,5,11,"I'm getting 30V on the common wire for an outlet at my house (30 NEV, single phase 120V).  When I flip off the breaker, of course it goes away, so looks like probably stray voltage. Great, now I want to find the source of the problem. Taking a measurement on the same circuit closer to the breaker panel, there's no NEV. So I guess there are three possibilities:

1. Examine wiring and receptacles downstream (farther away from the panel, past the outlet showing NEV).

2. Examine wiring and receptacles upstream (between the measurement with no NEV and the one with NEV).

3. The entire circuit should show NEV, this isn't a stray voltage issue.

Thoughts? As a side note, troubleshooting the entire circuit is laborious so I'd like go the right direction from the problem outlet.

Thanks.

Edit: additionally, I did a fair amount of googling and found a lot of related information that didn't answer my question."

White residue on wood after sanding stain off,8,5,"https://imgur.com/a/JNgafb1

Picture attached. It doesn't look bad in the picture but in person it's really not so good. 

So I'm doing a diy table using the hammarp solid wood counter top. I was staining the wood using ikeas wood stain but then, like an idiot, I put a thick coat on AND put it perpindicular to the grain. You could see the stain pattern on the wood and it was horrendous. So I decided to sand the stain off and try again... The right way. 

So I put 220 on a block and started sanding with the grain. Got it smooth, and feeling flat, but you could see white residue that was the stain. It wouldn't come off so I went down to 180 and you could still see it.

Funny thing is that I could rub it off with my fingers but not sand paper. I tried mineral spirit and nothing.

I'd like to get it off before I restain it. Any ideas?

I have a da orbital sandar that might do a better job but I was told using that on a butcher block style would is a horrible idea."

"Advice on Laying Vinyl Flooring, About 1/8 Inch Underlayment in Bathroom",3,3,"Hi all,

Hi,  we are in the process of laying down CoreTec vinyl plank (floating) floor in a bathroom and adjoining hallway.  Both areas are on a wooden subfloor.  We have removed the ceramic tile/cement board in the bathroom and wood floor in the hallway.  The bathroom also has a 1/8 inch of wooden sheeting stapled to the subfloor.  The only place there will be a difference in thickness of subfloor would be the threshold between the bathroom and hallway.  The underlayment is underneath the vanity, so removing the subfloor would not be easy.

Question:  Since this is a floating floor, can we put some type of floor patch on the subfloor? We really do not want to do a transition piece in the doorway.

Ceiling Fan Wiring Question,6,12,"Electricity baffles me. I can frame you a house, but know nearly nothing about electrical.

My house was built in late 2018. The builder saved money by building the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms with a single switch and light. I am putting new Hunter fans with lights in each room. I want the switch to provide power and I will control the light and/or fan by the switch chains hanging down from the fan.

The ceiling has 5 wires: bare copper, green, black, white, and red (It looks like the green just grounds to the box in the ceiling.)

The fan mount has a single green/yellow wire attached to the side of the mount itself.

The fan itself has 4  wires: green/yellow, white, blue, and black.

The instructions say for a single switch:

- connect ceiling bare copper to the 2 fan green/yellows
- connect the ceiling black wire to the fan black and blue wires
- connect ceiling white to fan white
- no mention of red


This does not work when I hook it up this way. When I took the original light down the only 2 ceiling wires hooked up were red and white. I am guessing the red has power, by my tester has been missing since we moved a few months ago. (I try to never use guess and electricity in the same sentence, but...)


Any help would be appreciated.

Lawn Mower Trouble,3,10,"Hello everyone, 

I have a question I've researched to no avail. I have a Snapper riding mower, 38"" LT200 (sorry don't know exact year, at least 5 years old. 

Engine: Briggs & Stratton 502cc, 18.5HP.  

I was mowing yesterday when I ran over something. The mower instantly turned off. Since then, it won't start .  More specifically, engine won't even attempt to turn over at all. Almost is like when the battery is completely dead.  Never had this issue before, and it was running fine before this happened. 

I've checked the battery leads and battery itself which are fine. Don't know where to start next. I thought maybe the flywheel key broke but it seems that it should at least turn over, correct? 

Any suggestions on what to try next would be much appreciated. Also if there's a better subreddit please let me know. Thanks!"

Outlet stuck in electrical box,8,23,"Dumb novice here - I tried installing a USB outlet and got it stuck in the electrical box.

I tested it before shoving it in the box, turned the breaker back off, shoved it in, and now the breaker wont turn on. The wires are heavy gauge and the box barely fits the outlet, so it took a lot of pushing to get it in. Tried pulling it back out to check the wiring but its stuck. 

I saw a tool online that can grip plugs but it doesnt seem available anywhere: https://www.amazon.com/pluggrip-p-1-wiring-warning-safety/dp/b0006g9a9u

Is there another tool or method for gripping/removing outlets?

Video doorbell forgot the power! Help!,6,5,"Hello all!

I'm renovating my own house here in Spain and wanted to install a video doorbell, so I can open the door from upstairs.

I installed the wires I needed, but never realized the screen needs a powersource. As is, it comes with a 13.5v 800ma transformer that needs to be plugged in.

I have no wallplug close, but I do have the main power box within reach.

I can buy a transformer that I can install in the power box and that would  solve my problem, but it is for a doorbell and only 12v and 800ma.

Would this be a big problem, or do I have a good chance the screen will function?

With the other transformer delivering less volt, I wont risk destroying the screen, right?

Exploding light bulbs. Can't for the life of me figure out a possible reason.,2,15,"My retired parents have a ceiling fan with a four bulb fixture attached.

The claim that ONE of the sockets keeps burning out or shattering bulbs. They say at least two incandescent bulbs (but they think it was more) have burned  out in a matter of hours or a couple of days, one bulb shattered and rained shards of glass on the table. They replaced all of the bulbs with glass globed LED bulbs and the bulb in that same socket exploded and rained glass all over the place.

I have done a good amount of electrical work in my time, but I cannot think of anything in a light socket that could cause this.

As per the incandescent bulbs I told them that they had to have gotten a bad batch of bulbs, but they swear that they used different brands.

And then there is the LED bulb that did the same thing.

Any ideas?

Tried combing through the forum before making my post, so here it is:

Bought a tv mount from Videosecu for my tv, in the instructions it says to use a drill bit measuring 5/32"" and drilling 2-1/4"" deep then to hand-torque in the lag bolts provided. My drill bit went in the correct depth, but I somehow can not seem to get the lag bolt even an inch in, when I torque the bolt to my max, it just stays in place, tried using a power drill with a lug attachment to torque it in but even that did not work, didn't budge. Any idea what could be causing this issue? I followed DIYs and followed their same action, so I think the issue lies somewhere in my wall (it is drywall). Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"

"[Request] I would like to refinish an antique citrus juicer. Can anyone suggest a paint that is both ""Acid resistant"" and ""food safe""?",5,14,"Greetings DIY,

I recently pick up an old Griswold citrus juicer I was hoping you all could help me out with. The original black paint flakes off pretty easily so I know it'll have to be stripped prior to use. My concern is the paint was used to protect the Iron frame so once the piece has been stripped I would like to repaint the frame to protect the metal frame from corrosive nature of citrus juices. That's where I was hoping you all could come in. I'm looking for suggestions on the best way to clean the aluminum insert as well as suggestions on non corrosive food safe paints (ideally spray paints?) I could use to refinish this badboy once I scrub all the oil paint off.

Open loft hatch from floor without a pole?,6,6,"Hi All,

Hoping someone might be able to help; I've just had my Loft hatch break away from the loft ladder. And instead of simply fixing it, I've thought it would be a good excuse to actually replace the whole thing, as I've been annoyed at having to use the pole to open the thing!

But, having searched online, I can't seem to find a hatch door with handle that would allow me to open the loft from the floor below. (I'd been dreaming in my head of a handle that runs flush with the loft door, with a cord that I could reach to pull at the handle which would pull down, or twist to allow me to open the loft. When closing, I could use the handle to push the loft door closed and when I let go, it springs back up, flush with the loft door again.)

As I say, I've searched Google, but it seems all loft hatches require a pole to open. I must say, I was surprised that it wasn't more of a popular (or even POSSIBLE) thing. Thinking of the physics of it more, I can sort of understand!! Lol. But hoping that someone here has seen something on their travels??

&#x200B;

TL;DR:

Has anyone here come across anything that might allow me to open and close the loft hatch without a pole from the floor below?"
Releasing a 2 part plaster mold?,3,2,"Im sure the answer to this is out there somewhere but I cant seem to find it.

I'm making a 2 piece mold to cast wolf wax (machine wax) positives for casting in 1 piece investment powder molds via a burnout. I have a bag of plaster of paris that I'm attempting to use to make a master with to save myself 50$. Investment powder isnt cheap. 

This isnt by first time making molds of various materials, and im familiar with all but one problem here. What im about to describe is by no means the proper way to do this with plaster, so input there is also appreciated if there is an easier or more correct way. Ive done some small scale tests. With a section of cured plaster, I applied an oil that I felt was of the right consistency not to absorb too deeply (vegetable oil) to the mating surface. I then poured freshly mixed plaster onto it. Ive done this before without oil and noticed that plaster tends to naturally seperate along a line where 2 different batches were poured after the first was cured. In this test, they did seperate as such, but a couple pieces seemed to push the oil out of the way (along the edges and directly in the center where it was poured), and these areas bit hard enough to worry me on a large scale (2 sq/ft) mold. Even if small areas bite, on that size of mold, this can quickly become a problem.

Is there something that works better to allow them to release while not soaking into the poures? Is this completely wrong and I should be using another method entirely? To be clear, im not casting with a metal positive, and my problem isnt getting the master pattern to release from the plaster. Its in getting the plaster halves to release from themselves after pouring the second half. I have used some other materials such as corn starch and even mold release which I typically use in my silicone 2 part molds, to the same effect. Maybe its my coverage, and im missing spots, or maybe the lils are beading up during the few minutes where im mixing? I dont know. 

What the heck is everyone doing to get 2 halves of plaster to seperate?"

Is sealing and insulating basement sills a good idea?,2,9,"I have an unfinished basement with open joists and sills. There are definitely drafts of air coming in around the edge where the joists rest on the top of the foundation. I am thinking of sealing in between the joists by filling the space between joists with fibreglass insulation batting, then foam board sealed with expanding foam. That will prevent any air flow into the basement, and insulate from the outside wall above the sills.

However, there are two concerns I have:
1) Do I also need to seal around the outside edge with caulking or expanding foam, where the outside wall meets the foundation? Otherwise Im wondering if I will be forcing outside air up inside the wall, or at least in the space between the outside wall and foam board.

2) The drafty basement was being ventilated by that small amount of airflow. Will it create knock-on affects because of reduced or no air exchange now? Like mustiness or dampness? Do modern airtight basements require ventilation?

If anyone can offer any advice, Id really appreciate it."

Restoring an Old Rusty Craftsman Toolbox,2,2,"So I got a used Craftsman tool box for $0. It's in really good condition except for the bottom drawer which must have held water. It's extremely rusty. There's some small surface rust here and there elsewhere.

I've been doing tons of research and I can't find a method I'm 100% confident in to remove rust before painting without ending up with either a thick rust converter layer or the rust returning under the new paint. There seems to be many opinions on the internet and different methods for different applications.

I've already broken down the tool box into it's components. This is the plan I'm currently considering:

1. Use a wirebrush to remove any rust flakes.
2. Sand remaining surface rust.
3. Spray surface rust areas with rust converter (is this even necessary?)

Trouble making drinking glasses from wine bottle,9,19,"Hi guys,

So I've been trying to make glasses from wine bottles following this process: 

1. Remove sticker and clean bottle. 
2. Make a cut around the bottle using a simple homemade rig. 
3. Slowly pour boiling water on the cut. 
4. Gently tap the bottle on the sides of a bucket filled with water at room temperature (it's winter in Uruguay, so about 12/15 degrees). 

However the end result is a 50% success rate and the process is quite slow. Half of the time the bottle breaks poorly. 

Some pics here: https://imgur.com/gallery/3CbMAXL

Would you happen to know what might be wrong with my process? 
Thanks a bunch!

Bulletin Board Walls,2,5,"There are murals on my basement walls. I'd like to cover them up with floor-to-ceiling bulletin boards for my home office. But I can't damage the murals. So far, I've only see [this](https://www.younghouselove.com/more-room-for-grumpy-snowman/) kind of project, where a thin wood panel backing is attached to the wall with drilled screws, and I can't drill holes. It seems like I can buy large sheets of corkboard ([here](https://www.schooloutfitters.com/catalog/product_info/pfam_id/PFAM25035/products_id/PRO39992?sc_cid=Google_NOR-RC46&adtype=pla&kw=&CAWELAID=1238934288&CAGPSPN=pla&CAAGID=12912490097&CATCI=pla-789063711765&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5bvx9LCF5AIVrP_jBx04IQjhEAQYBSABEgIMz_D_BwE)) or ones that come with backing already attached ([NovaCork from Homasote](http://www.homasote.com/products/novacork)), but the installation instructions appear to require drilling a few holes in the wall. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&v=r4NrzwjTpz4) shows how to use glue, but I think that will damage the mural too, and wouldn't it also risk pushpins poking holes through the cork into the wall? At about 2:25, that video suggests that painter's tape can be used instead (which seems to me to be the best option so far), but wouldn't I still have to put some kind of backing there? (And if I am using tape, whereas Homasote suggests drilling, am I risking the whole thing falling down on me?)

I'm happy to hire someone to do this, but I need to know what they would be doing... if it's even possible. Help?"

Replacing Vinyl Windows...DIY?,2,3,"Hi, hope this is the right place to ask this. I have a condo with lots of vinyl sash windows. A few years ago, the seals on a few of them failed, so they developed spots and blotches on the inside glass. I called to replace them a few months after the warranty expired, but as others in my building had the same issue over the years, the manufacturer agreed to replace the faulty windows if I pick them up, but not to do the full install. They estimate that to send someone out to replace them will be between $500-$1000. 

So, I'll have about 6 windows to replace. 4 of them are the lower sliding part, 2 of them are the top part that doesn't move. 

1. I'm not even sure what to search to find advice on this, as every video or article I can find shows how to install the whole frame, not just the part. Do they just snap out somehow?

2. I'm somewhat handy, but have never done anything like this before. Is this the kind of thing I want to attempt myself?

[Discussion] Poor paintjob fix?,2,22,"So i have a Launchpad that i disassembled because i wanted to paint it white. In order for the paint to stick to it i gave it a good sanding and then i spray painted it. 

Apparently i went too hard on the sanding and I applied a thick layer of paint to compensate. While visually it looks fine, it feels rough and dusty on the hand. 

Is it worth it to sand down the paint and get a fine grid sandpaper to make it smooth and then repaint it? Or should i just leave it as is?

wiring help: Fan with light and nightlight,2,16,"I have two switches, one wired to all the lights in the bathroom, and one running to the fan. Both switches are wired with 14/2 (R, B, and ground).

Help powering led strip,2,8,"Hi.

 I'd like to light my shed by using an led strip.

Is there a way I can get 12v through USB 2? If not, will using USB3 help? Assuming I have a power bank with a 12v usb output.

Otherwise what would be the best way to power the leds in a shed? I may eventually run power from the mains to the shed and was thinking of using USB wall sockets.

Please advise me.

Having issues with water/sediment from my yard going into my neighbor's yard,6,6,"So, we had to bite the bullet and have a new seawall installed in the backyard. Although there are a 1000 things Id have rather spend that money on its nice to not have to worry about it in the future. Unfortunately, this is causing an issue with my neighbor's yard. As the seawall was installed over our old failing wall our yard is now about 8"" higher than the neighbors and were having an issue with the drainage during our crazy Florida rain storms. The issue looks to be is when it rains hard the ground over-saturates and water just flows down towards the neighbors yard. I have all of the downspouts from the roof connected into pipes running down the side of the yard and through the seawall to help mitigate some of the water but that is not enough. I'd really like to not have to regrade that side of the yard as it's a lot of work and I really don't know if that would help. One of the seawall guys mentioned a sheet that you can pound into the ground along the fence line and it will divert the water back towards our property. I'm not worried about the water pooling or causing damage on our side as the seawall has a ton of drainage to move water from the yard to the canal. I've tried looking online and in the big box stores and cannot for the life of me find anything that like those sheets. Does anyone have any ideas on what that product is called? Or if you have any possible solutions that would be great too. Thanks for the help!

How to fix an inherited chest freezer,2,4,"So, my dad had a 25 year old chest freezer that defrosted and stopped cooling, so he gave it to me.  I was hoping it would be something easy to fix like a bad relay or a wire got corroded and disconnected.  So, the freezer turns on after plugging it in without problem.  The condenser makes a low hum, like it is working.  The condenser does heat up as well after being on a while.  After leaving it overnight, the condenser never turns off, not even for a short time.  The tubes coming out of the condenser are warm on both sides.  The inside of the freezer does not change temperature at all.

From what I've read, I believe with a bad relay, the condenser generally switches on and off.  A bad temperature control thermostat (potentiometer), also relates to turning on the condenser.  What I've come up with is that I may have a freon leak.  Is there a way to test this, or another more likely problem?  Or did I miss something, and is there something else I should check?"

First time buyer. House has an old window resized with plasterboard? How can I fix it?,3,6,"**Background:**

Me and my fiance bought a house last year and we have since renovated two bedrooms, the lounge and the garden. It was well looked after by the previous owner, but very dated, as she had owned it since the 70s and had used wood chip wallpaper to hide numerous sins. Fortunately, I've been able to fix it to a standard we are happy with, but I am now starting on the kitchen.

**Problem:**

Unfortunately, the [dining area window](https://i.imgur.com/ylSkHIw.jpg) was made smaller when an extension was built onto the back of the house and the plasterboard (?) used to resize it is [significantly thicker than the rest of the wall](https://i.imgur.com/Uy7kKG6.jpg). 

Is there anyway to fix this without removing the material and starting over? I'm not sure what the best way to tackle it would be...

**Unsuccessful Attempt:**

Out of sheer optimism [I used an electric plane on a small area](https://i.imgur.com/Qt1iHqb.jpg) but it won't cut deep enough and it created a significant amount of dust, and I'm not entirely convinced shaving the plaster down is the right solution. 

**Context:**

The house is in the UK, was built in the 50s, all the walls are built from brick (even the internal walls). This is the only patch of plasterboard/mystery material that needs fixing.

Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Need help with air dry clay for dog paw prints,6,8,"Last month, we had to put down one of my dogs, and as part of the euthanasia ""package"" we had a mold made of my dog's paw prints.

Is there any way to re-dry or re-harden the clay? I've never used air dry clay and after googling to problem I couldn't find anything.

My dog was cremated so we can't redo this. I've attached a photo of the prints in case it helps. The prints look they've already been squished from going through the mail so I'm trying to minimize any further damage. I put it in the fridge for a few minutes because I was freaking out a little.

How Would You Try To Fix This Broken Air Compressor,2,10,"I have a cheap air compressor from Harbor Freight.  The tube that runs from the compressor to the tank broke.  It was a metal tube and it [cracked](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/46994182014_c22b691287_o.jpg).  

I went to my local hardware store and found a bit of tubing that is 1/8"" outer diameter that fits into the existing nut.  Looks like [this](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/40817261373_8b7c229d70_o.jpg).  I would fit the tube into the nut and use a compression sleeve.  Then I would lather the whole thing in epoxy and let it dry for a few days.  This solution works for a little bit, but after some use the tube and epoxy just wasn't robust enough.  It would struggle as the tank fills to about 40 psi.  The heat and the rattling would destroy the epoxy on the connection coming from the compressor and it would pop out.  

Is there a better way to fix this?  Basic epoxy and non-metal tubing doesn't seem robust enough to withstand the heat + rattling.  How would you try to fix it?

Thanks!"

Plumbing Mystery,4,7,"So 8 or so months ago my plumbing went bad. Youd flush the toilet on the second floor and it would backup into the tub in the same bathroom. I put acid down the pipes (pvc) and snaked it a few times. Seemed to fix the problem. Now here I am 8+ months since then and Im having the same problem, but the acid and snaking isnt working. Other thoughts? 
Some more info, the washer drain goes to the same vent stack. And that drains water just fine as far as I can tell. Not sure what is happening. There are also signs of water on the first floor ceiling now, Im hoping that just from me messing with the drain on the tub though. 
Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I really dont have the money for a plumber."

I bought something like this from home depot(https://www.homedepot.com/p/RIDGID-KwikSpin-1-4-in-x-25-ft-Auger-57038/303644603) but it didn't help at all. I think I need something more powerful. 

I came across this video on YT https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBrlIBlvkP8, my problem is similar except I don't actually know where the end of the opening is. The snake they use in the video seems like it would do the job? Where can I get something like that? I don't see anything like that at home depot or amazon.

Refinished my dining table,23,1,"Had an 10 year old table that loved so much because it can go from being for 2 people to a large gathering by adding leaves.  However the kids had left their mark on the table never mind all the cleaning over time.  Called a few places for quotes and was getting quoted almost \~$1000  for it which is more than I paid for the table.

So bought some lacquer paint at Benjamin Moore and had them tint it grey.  Bought paint thinner and a spray gun to connect with the compressor at home. 

Required a lot of prep work to clean off the tops and the legs where everything seemed to be sticking.  Used steel wool and 320 sand paper to get it  ready enough.  Since the table is MDF didn't want to risk any cracking or hardware issues so covered up the clasps and railings with painter tape and paper and went to town spraying.  Mixed the grey lacquer with lacquer thinner and sprayed it using the spray gun.

https://i.redd.it/mj489i466fg31.jpg

One  coat was enough to get it from the white to the grey.  Did some steel wool again to rough up the surface and get the paint to stick and went with rounds 2 and 3.

Transforming carpet stairs to wood for under $100,14,6,"Re-posted, since original post was deleted for not having enough info. Redditors, please let me know if the information below is enough for someone to perform the same project. If not, let me know what information do you want to know? I felt like admin wrongfully deleted my original post. 

Our stairs were carpet. And it was so ugly, we had to do something about it. We decided to make it a DIY project after seeing so many people having success transforming their carpet stairs to wood.

Saturday. We had to pull up the carpet, tools required utility knife and gloves. After we pulled out the carpets, there were thousands of stables stuck to the wood and carpet glues or whatever those white stuff are.

Sunday-Thursday. Next step is using a plier and hand pull the staples. It was so many I almost gave up, but I decided to pull some everyday after work. Then we used a $5 plastic wood filler from HD to fill up all the major holes that were on the wood.

Friday-Saturday. Next we borrow a sanding machine from a friend, and bought a large pack of sanding on amazon for $12. We taped a plastic sheet at the top of the stair and at the bottom of the stairs while we sand to minimize the particles from going everywhere in the house, probably only stopped like 60%. Sanding took a lot longer than we exepcted, 2 full days of work to sand the steps, and the railing so it can be stained also.

Sunday-Monday. After we finished sanding, we used an $8 wood stain, I believe the color is Kona. First time staining wood, I did not wipe it quickly enough so the color appeared much darker almost black on pictures. We stained every other step so we can still get upstairs to our bedroom.

Tuesday-Thursday. We applied a $20 floor finisher (semi-gloss) on the wood. Same step as staining, we applied every other steps.

Friday. For the backboard, we bought 2 of the 48x96 in beadboard white true bead panel from HD for $40. We cut it up to size with a table saw and used liquid nails to attach it to the backboard.

The whole project spanned over 3 weeks and probably spent about 45-50 hours to finish. The color was darker than expected, but it looks nice with the white backboard.

Help Request: Stubborn Locking Device in Old Doorhandle,1,3,"Hello - I'm trying to switch out a dozen old (1940s or 50s) door handles in my house. They're actually simpler to work with than many of the brass door handles I've seen removal videos for, except for one thing. There's a locking ""button"" with a metal shaft that runs transversely through the handle, preventing the latch from opening.

I was able to remove all parts of the door handle without issue except for this latch. I'm not opposed to cutting it, but I don't have enough space to do so presently and would need to damage the door further to achieve that. Does anyone have experience with these and how to remove it?

Things I've tried so far:

* Pulling on the ""button"".
* Pushing it through the near side of the door.
* Pushing it through the far side of the door.
* Pressing the latch in while attempting to push/pull the lock ""button"" out.

I can't see any other screws to remove from its current state. Thanks for any help you can provide!

"Is it possible to fix this door? If so, how do I do it?",4,39,"It seems to be thinly layered wood. Some of the layers are bent inwards and are hard to pop back. Ideally the door would be restored to almost original state but if I can just even the surface it's sufficient as well. I have a large poster to cover almost the entire door. 

[Image of the door](https://ibb.co/Vmhk6yV)

Update:

I sprayed some expanding foam into the door via the small cracks, waited 2 hours for it to expand (and boy did it!). After that I used thin white woodfiller and applied it generously. That was a bit of a mistake because it started cracking after drying. So I sanded it back down with G80 and then applied a new thin layer that has now dried and I've sanded it again, this time with G180. It's now very smooth and flush with the rest of the door except for the edges with tend to crumble when sanding to thin.

Need help with potential asbestos insulation,7,14,"Builder arrived today to start work on boarding out loft, and he lifted up all the insulation to move some joists. Under insulation is old piped insulation, which he didn't really mention. When I looked at it after he'd left, I got worried: What if its asbestos?

I did lots of googling, visited our next door neighbours, and phoned an asbestos company who said they'll come out tomorrow to test it (for 200, of course). Meanwhile, if it IS asbestos, the house is probably full of fibres from the full day of work the builder did.

The neighbours said the whole street had fibreglass insulation piped in years ago and it's not asbestos. But those neighbours can only account for the last ~40 years, not when the house was built (1950s). Its possible that underneath that fibreglass is blown in asbestos insulation.

The builder, on the other hand, hadn't mentioned anything at all while he was working (and didn't wear a mask), but when I texted him he said ""yes its probably asbestos"" and asked would I like him to bring his hoover tomorrow to remove it?

My immediate response was no, we will stop work and get it tested. He called me and said that would take ages and he used to have an asbestos license so it'll be fine.

That's not fine - he's clearly not at all careful, otherwise he would have taken precautions today while he was working. I don't want him anywhere near this until we know either way. This is all terrible. Not good.

So the builder is angry because he knows we're stopping work to sort this out, and he wants to push it forward and get the job finished and get paid.I told him we can talk about it first thing next day when he gets here, at which point my husband and I will offer to pay him for all materials and his time so far, and stop work until we've had the material properly tested and removed if needed.

Meanwhile, our open loft hatch is covered with taped up bin bags, because I wouldn't let my husband go back into the loft to find the hatch itself. 

This feels like a terrible situation and I don't know what to do - any advice?"

"Hoping for some information on what I can, and cannot, expect from Bondo!",1,8,"tl;dr - If I were to try to make something like the green calf-plates on [these awesome spur-pads](https://www.sherrilltree.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/241x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/1/41150-gecko-steel-climbers-web.jpg), would a fiberglass product like bondo be a worthwhile approach or would it just shatter / crack-up the first time it was used?  I'd be using reinforcements inside the layers of fiberglass but unsure if it's an OK material to use at all here, am guessing the product shown uses a plastic..

~~~~~~~~

I LOVE DIY and make my own stuff whenever I can, sadly this (fiberglass resins) is an area I'm woefully unfamiliar with, I'm skilled with fast-setting stuff like bondo like I can use 5min drywall spackle w/o issue, fast-dry cement-based products, have just never used this stuff so while I expect it *could* work I think my biggest uncertainty is just how fragile the stuff is going to be when making something that's subjected to minor pressures and is, relatively-speaking, a very skinny casting/form (those pad-shells I want to make, so my DIY spurs' padding isn't just lashed in-place with nylon webbing lol, are going to be like 1/2"" thick but an ~8""x12"" footprint)  

Of course I'll be using some form of 'skeleton' inside it, I didn't realize I omitted fiberglass sheeting til I got home but have to expect that the flexible-yet-resilient fabric I have that's used in the same manner only for roofing-tars, that that'll be suitable here - I'm also picturing 'rebar' (read: bicycle spokes that I'll just cut-to-size with the angle-grinder!!) used both throughout the body as well as ""a border""/around the entire perimeter of such a project - is this type of approach going to be something that's more, or less, likely to work?


Thanks a ton for any&all help/advice, I LOVE the idea of being able to use forms to make things with something besides cement/mortars because of their inherent limitations, I've got a good feeling this is the right path for, say, making a custom outer-shell for a chainsaw or things like that but I've never worked with it or seen it worked with so hoping for thoughts on whether my expectations for it are wayyy too high or not lol :D 

Again thank you for any answers/suggestions/tips etc they are greatly appreciated!!!

[PS- I just wanna be super clear about the spur-padding project, this is NOT going to risk my spurs' grip if the thing failed as its only function would be to contour my rubber padding to my leg, I'd still have my same 1"" nylon webbing going around the spurs' upper-metal rod so this is really just aesthetics but, since my calf will be bumping it, I'd hate to waste teh time just to find they're full of cracks after the first use - *IF* that's the case/expectation, any suggestions on what else to do / use would be greatly appreciated, for instance I know that some of these 'pad shells' are made of carbon fiber and, so far as I understand it, that's basically the same as bondo+fiberglass sheeting (only it's stronger because the carbon-fiber sheeting is stronger - though I'm clueless whether it's 50%, or 5000%, stronger!]"

"Best way to enlarge a hole from 1.25""-1.5"" or larger?",3,25," I'm a gardener, and as part of that hobby, I have rain barrels.

I got these particular rain barrels from our local environmental action council & some from Craigslist, which look like the original owners obtained from the same council. 

The problem I am having is that the plumbing fixtures that were added, were siliconed on, and not super well so I have been replacing them with bulkhead fittings with hose threading--the spigots/taps worked out GREAT, but the overflows are still not large enough. This means that I can't daisy chain the barrels together currently.

Initially, I expanded the holes from 3/4"" to 1-1/4"" using a step drill for the the current overflows.

I'd like to expand the overflows to 1-1/2"" or potentially larger but I can't seem to find the right way or tool to do this.

I can't seem to find a step drill over 1-3/8"", where my current one maxes out, and I can't use the 'oops' arbors I have seen because the arbor on those is circular whereas my holesaw kit has a sort of square off circular arbor.  


I'm considering using my step drill to max the holes out to 1-3/8"" and then using either my dremel tool or a file/rasp to expand it that last 1/8"". How viable a solution is this? Should I try something else?

EDIT: Thank you all for your kind suggestions. I decided to go with the step drill & file combo I planned on, with u/MisterHiggins confirming it was a viable option.

It took longer than I thought, but not very long. The hole isn't quite perfect, but since this was for the gasket that the hose goes into, it's perfect enough. 

I'd recommend anyone interested in purchasing a holesaw kit to first consider buying a spade bit/paddle bit instead. Also get a kit with circular arbors so you can use 'oops arbors'.

Or, you know, just drill the right size hole, or don't try to retrofit something with the wrong size hole."
Help Request: Replacing a Power Receptacle in an Old House with Old Wires,9,19,"I need to replace a two-hole power outlet with a new two-hole power outlet, and I ran into a little issue. I think the wiring in my house is fairly old since it was built in 1950, so I need some help understanding how things work. The instructions I've seen on YouTube and just about any other DIY guide only talk about black and white wires. But this one only has black and brown wires! (Please take a look at [this picture](https://ibb.co/qgQ4RcR) of my wiring). 

**So, my question is:** **Which wire goes on the left** **(black or brown), where the bigger prong on a plug is inserted?** 

*I'm totally new to electrical,* *and* *trying to maintain a low-frizz buzz cut.* *Thank you for your help!*

Bonus Karma: I know two-hole receptacles should be upgraded to three-hole receptacles with GFCI and grounding. If I wanted to replace my old two-hole receptacles with GFCI, could I do this with only those two pictured wires (black and brown)?"

This is my first project using metal, aluminium specifically. Ive managed to drill and tap a M4 0.7 thread into the end of a rod but the M4 0.7 screws I bought seem to be damaging the internal threads and not screwing in smoothly at all. Have I created the internal thread incorrectly? or are my screws just badly sized?

Any help massively appreciated!

I built an Outdoor Wood Fired Brick Oven (AIC),977,178,"First post was removed. I hope I got this one right. Sorry

 Let me start by saying I am by no means a professional brick mason or artisan.

I started building this oven in mid April. With an 18 month old child, full time job and plenty of other chores around the house it was tough to carve out the time needed to complete it. I attempted to complete and have pizzas by July 4th but it just wasnt in the cards with all of our other family activities. But last weekend we finally broke it in with a delightful pizza party.

My goal is to build a roof structure over it before the weather hits this fall.

All in Id say I have about 100-150 hours into it. It weighs somewhere between 12,000 -15,000 pounds. I truly enjoy the labor. It was sometimes a good way to clear my head at the end of a difficult work day.

This is the 2nd Oven Ive completed. The first one was built at our previous home and unfortunately we unexpectedly moved about 8 months after it was completed.

I made a HUGE mistake...*drywall*,1,13,"Last year you were all so helpful with tips on how to remove latex paint. So here's hoping you have some ideas on the nonsense I've gotten myself into!
So, I'm still working on the same walls (I know, I know). 
I've gotten the paint off to the drywall, I've sanded and I've applied drywall primer. 
Well, one wall (and of course  it's a wall that is the entire length of the semi-detached I live in) is a mess.  There are so many imperfections showing it's going to drive me crazy. 
The other 3 walls look great. 
But I must not have sanded properly in all spots. 
What are my options with this ridiculousness?
Gods help me, I suspect I'm going to have to remove the paint from that entire middle section but (running lengthwise of the entire wall), ugh. 
Would a skim coat work? I assume that, to even it out, I'd have to skim coat the entire wall (and then sand it...I can already hear my shop vac cry) ???"

Wiring up 3-terminal membrane switches for Freemotion 330R.,2,1,"Hi folks.
I want to solder in some regular push buttons to replace the overpriced membrane switch that was built in.  Re-doing the traces with conductive ink isn't an option for a few reasons.

Anyhow, after trying to map out the top and bottom layers, it seems that this is a three contact system.  Is there a convention or rule of thumb for knowing which 2 wires of the three to pair on one side for a SPST button?  I'd rather not short out what I have left, and this is a bit difficult to throw a multimeter at.  Thank you.

This is sort of what it seems I'm dealing with.
https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/367582/why-short-3-terminals-per-contact-on-a-membrane-keypad

EDIT:  updated with info.

I took a multimeter to the board and tested the 10 contacts. 1-6 and 9-10 all had 7vAC on them. 7 and 8 were very low comparatively. Now I'm really confused. You'd think the higher voltages would all tie into 7 or 8, but that's not how they match up on the membrane.

DIY fine casting concrete?,4,17,"Heya. So my parents just got obsessed with casting concrete things and bought all the things to make molds, cast and paint. And in the process learned why I'm always wearing tattered clothes and never have a tidy workspace :p 

However, casting fine detailed things like small ornaments would require a much finer concrete mix - a so-called ""hobby concrete"" which is unfortunately insanely expensive in comparison. 
Can I make something like that myself? The purpose is outdoor use like lawn and doorstep ornaments so we can't just use plaster. 

My current thought has been to use super fine sand, cement powder and reinfocing plastic fibers. I was going to run the sand and the powder through a fine mesh to sort out all larger chunks. I'm not even sure if this would work. 
Is there a better way to do it? Companies sell it so it must be doable"

First DIY project. Built a wall and wardrobes from scratch!,39,4,"

Almost a year ago, my wife and I moved to Northern Sweden from the UK. I'm a teacher and have no DIY experience. It's a joke in my family that I'm so useless I'll walk around with a hammer shouting 'plumbing'.

Anyway, we got pregnant and bought a house in May. The house is beautiful... There are actually two houses on the same property! Both ours. However, the main bedroom is downstairs and my wife wanted to turn a huge living room/teenagers hangout into our master bedroom so we could be closer to the baby.

Easy enough! Build a wall, fit a door, build a wardrobe, plaster and paint. My school holidays were 10 weeks long. It probably took me 4 weeks of solid work to get this done.

I've included an imgur gallery. I made lots of mistakes but learned alot! Bought lots of tools and really surprised myself with how well I did. I could not have done it without my neighbour, who is an amazing old Swedish guy. Doesn't speak English, so it really helped me develop my Swedish. He allowed me to help myself to his workshop and any time, day or night. And to use his trailer to collect materials!

Waterproof based sealant for slate steps?,4,3,"Hello r/DIY!

I am looking for the best way to waterproof-seal the joins on slate steps? 

As a bit of background on I'm dealing with: we have 6 slate steps leading up to the front door. Underneath the steps is a 'room' that used to hold the coal back-in-the-day when coal-men used to come 'round and dump coal into the little room by lifting the first step. There's access to this little room from inside the house, and the people living there would go down into the basement and get the coal for the fireplace etc.

On the steps, there's a little gap between where two slate meet/sit on each other - I wish to apply some sort of sealant to the whole width of the crack, but as this it totally new to me, I am unsure what the best way to go is. There's evidence that something was there before, but it's cracked away. Water is now seeping in through these tiny little gaps, and I wish to stop it. (The steps are outdoor, at the front of the house.)

Does anyone ave any recommendations on what to use on the slate? Would some sort of waterproof based silicone work for this?

Thanks!"

Bought a Hybrid Hot Water Tank. Is it too big a project to install?,2,3,"I recently purchased a Hybrid Hot water tank. It's electric, but also has heat pump technology to make it super efficient.

Our hot water currently comes out of our 26 year old oil powered boiler.  This is the next step of getting off oil completely and upgrading our whole heating system to a combination of wood stoving and electric heat.

The problem is, I had our boiler guys come out to give me an estimate on installation, and they want almost as much to install the thing as I paid for it! $1300! I've called some other plumbers and they won't install it because they didn't sell it. 

How complicated would it be to install myself? I'm good with the electrical, but I've never worked on copper pipes without help. How do I cut off the current system without flooding my basement?"

"Retiling Kitchen - do I have to go right down to the plywood, or can I smooth and reuse the thinset?",7,7,"I've begun renovating my kitchen and have removed everything. Just drywall, wires and dust remain. We are on the 4th floor of a condo, wood frame, built in '91.

I've pulled up all the tiles and I'm in the process of scraping away all the old mortar. Underneath is a layer of what looks like gray concrete and under that I assume is the plywood.

1. What, most likely is this layer? It is smooth and grey and looks/feels like concrete. It is quite pitted where the tiles were, but smooth where the cabinets were. Could it be backerboard? I don't see any screws or obvious seams.
2. Whatever this layer is, can I just patch and smooth over the pits and lay new tile over it? The old tiles I pulled up were installed in '91 when the building was built, and none were cracked, so I assume the floor was fairly well done and level.

Thanks!"

"Paver patio sub-base - is tamped, freshly moved soil OK?",1,6,"Installing a 12x16 patio in Ohio.  As I was working on yard drainage and learning to use the excavator, I dug the patio area out haphazardly to a depth of 2-5 inches.  I'm not sure why I did this, because I decided that the patio really needs to be quite higher than grade for yard drainage and aesthetics.  Looking at the picture, you can see I have now backfilled this area with leftover yard dirt which consists of a fair amount of clay.  My goal is to have the pavers **above** grade by about 6-8"" when all is finished.  Plan of attack:

* Machine tamp the newly moved soil to *grade* or *slightly below* grade
* Geotextile fabric laid down
* \~ 6"" Crusher run 21A tamped in layers
* 3/4"" concrete sand
* Travertine tiles
* Add fill dirt **around** the patio, so that the landscaping slopes down into the surrounding yard

I know that virgin, undisturbed soil is usually best to start the base on, but will my method outlined above still work?

Help Request: Swingset Revival,1,4,"I never considered myself to be handy, but my confidence has been growing since I became a home owner a few years ago. However, my latest project seems to go wrong at every turn, despite it seeming very easy.

We have had a playset for the last two years. However, it is already starting to show some wear and I wanted to get out in front of things so that it stayed looking like new. First, I powerwashed because I had some mold/mildew stains. I tried to be careful and not get too close or stay on one section for too long. However, despite my best efforts I fear that I did some damage to the wood. Then I tried using a deck/wood cleaner. Saw more success but still had some blotchy areas. I tested out a semi-transparent stain/sealant, but after one coat I already think I need something that does not show the wood grain (for reference, in the imgur link the bench has one coat of stain)

Normally I would keep plugging away, but I fear continuing this path and doing irreparable damage to a relatively new swingset. Does anybody have any advice when it comes to these projects? Do I have to sand (and to what effect) before staining if the wood seems to be in good shape? Any specific types to use?

Is polyurethane the correct resin for my application?,1,4,"So I bought an electric scooter and I wanted to make it go faster so I 3d printed a bigger gear which ended up spinning when the motor shaft got hot due to the extra load.

So I've been doing some research and it looks like I want to be using polyurethane resin but I want to be 100% sure before I shell out $45.
