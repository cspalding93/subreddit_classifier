My daughter created this whimsical rabbit cake stand from a broken plant holder she painted and attached a silver platter to. The banners were made with one old, white curtain, material scraps, twine, and markers. The stand its self was a curb find we hauled home, replaced the tabletop, and painted to look like reclaimed barn wood. Brunch was savory Parmesan and herb shortbread, honey orange curd with dark chocolate tea biscuits, Italian pasta salad, and lemon and dill cucumber sandwiches. Dessert was carrot cake and macrons.

Suggestions please!,1,1,"So my Father-in-Law is getting married to a wonderful woman on Nov 9th and I would like to make them something to celebrate their marriage as they are just doing a super simple court house wedding with no family unfortunately as they live in Alaska and none of us could afford to make it on such short notice (it was a whirlwind romance). So I want to send them something special. My craft strengths are wreaths, crocheting, lip balms/creams/salves. The only problem is, as they live in Alaska, anything I ship will have to be fairly small and light because shipping to Alaska from here (from anywhere really) is hella expensive. I also want to especially make his fiance feel welcome. She doesnt have much family of her own, no children, and has been lonely for quite some time, so I want her to know that she has family now and that were here for her/them. So if anyone has any ideas of something special I can make them I would love the input! I also dont mind experimenting with something new, so bring on all the ideas! Thanks!"

How do you price your work?,1,2,"First off sorry if this is the wrong place or against the rules, just looking for advice from some fellow crafters who may have some good experiences.

My wife is a hobbyist crafter, doing mostly custom one off crafts. Recently she decided she wanted to go to a craft show, and has been making a bunch of autumnal paper-flower wreaths, Halloween witches brooms, and some paper-pumpkin centerpieces. Problem is, we have no idea how to price her work, whats fair, what people are willing to pay, etc... Shes put a lot of work into them, and we wouldnt want to undercharge for her hard work. 

Im also a little worried she wont have enough stock, but she also wouldnt want to make too many in case they dont sell. Basically, does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what we can do to make this a great experience for her? Im attaching a few of her wreaths in comment for reference. Thanks all!"

Any print fabrics that look like it's made of feathers?,1,5,"I need to know where to find a fabric that looks like it's made of tiny feathers.

My son's school has a ""historical Haloween"" every year, in which students come up with a costume for a real or fictional character in history. This year's theme is the Americas, and my 10-year-old boy decided he wanted to be King Kamehameha I, the Hawaiian king. [Here's a picture.](http://herbkanehawaii.com/image-catalog/chiefs-alii/young-king-kamehameha-ch15/)

The traditional ceremonial garb worn by the King was expensive clothing (body wrap and cape) made of small feathers, and a helmet called a Mahiole, which resembles a Roman centurion helmet but it's covered completely in tiny feathers.

We can construct the mahiole using a baseball cap with the brim cut off to start with. We thought we could find some fabric that looks like feathers to make into clothing and also to cover the helmet and helmet crest.

The closest thing I could find on Amazon has [very large feathers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P687SBL). And I found a fabric at Joann's that is actually made of feathers but [it's fairly expensive at $70/yard](https://www.joann.com/gianna-heavy-solid-feather-fabric-55/zprd_16057630a.html#q=feather%2Bfabric&start=1) (it might be OK for the headdress though).

Any suggestions?"

I want to make my son a Halloween costume which is based off of a character he loves. Basically I need to make an entire ball which covers his whole body (maybe besides his head/arms.) I plan to stuff it with something. Any idea how much fabric I would need if he is 5' and I want the ball to be globe-shaped around his body? (maybe 3 ft wide all around.)

Thanks for any input, not even sure if I'm asking in the proper place. Also I have not sewed something since 7th grade, so...

Also, do glow in the dark fabrics exist? Ideally, his costume will glow. Unsure if to get a glow in the dark fabric paint to paint the entire thing or actual fabric which responds to lack of light source.

Making a simple leather cuff,1,0,"I'm no craftsman, but I have gone to a local crafts place (don't know what to call it in English), and gotten a bit of help with making a pair of sweaters and fingerless gloves. Now I kind of want to experiment with making a wrist cuff.

The place has strips of leather and an old sewing machine meant for leather, so I do have the objects needed. I'm just wondering what to do about pattern and what kind of fastener to go with. I'm not skilled enough to do anything truly elaborate yet, but I would appreciate suggestions for something cool that a newbie can manage.

And then there's the fastener issue. Do you think a simple little bit of strip of leather attached a little inwards from each end, for tying together, would do it?"
A [quite possibly] Strange Request,4,1,"Hello!

Someone on r/reddeadredemption pointed me in this direction to look for answers and/or help. So heres the story; a couple weeks ago, my mum started talking about my cat needing a hat. Normally this sort of thing trails off, but it hasnt this time. I know shes been super stressed with a lot of not nice things going on in our lives, so I thought that maybe this would give her a little respite of happiness. So I decided to endeavour to get my cat a hat. 

That being said, I am incredibly shallow and selfish and decided that if I was going to sink any money into a hat for a cat that hates literally everything, that I would seek out a hat that would also give me a little bit of happiness. 

That hat just so happens to be Arthur Morgans hat from Red Dead Redemption 2. 

So the Strange Request Im bringing forth is this: does anyone know of anyone or any place that might be able to indulge me in this? Maybe an Etsy store that doesnt show up in my cursory search, or someone on Instagram that I wouldnt think of, or even someone here that might be interested in the endeavour?

Need advice for pendant sealing,1,4,"Hello everyone, I'm new to this subreddit, but I figured this would be a good place to ask - I've been working on making pendants out of rocks I find at my local rivers and painting on them, and I've been looking for a good way to seal them so that they have a glossy finish, and will be less likely to break if dropped. At first I covered it with epoxy resin, which smooths itself out and has an even finish while adding a layer of protection, but that is difficult to apply, tends to have noticeable bubbles, and doesn't dry entirely clear (has a yellow-ish tint). I then tried a Krylon clear spray-on paint thing, and that also gave a nice gloss and even finish, but doesn't dry very well, and gets scratches in it extremely easy. So I then tried a clear enamel acrylic paint, but you need a paintbrush to apply it, which means you can see the paintbrush strokes so it's not smooth at all, and also tends to get scratched (despite the internet's claims that it was scratch resistant :/). So, I wanted to know if anyone had advice for some other substance I could use, or if there's a different way I could use any of the methods I listed above? Thank you so much!"

The model depicts ourselves and our toddler holding up a sonogram in a nursery. Ive even designed a box done up to look like the real thing. 

Wed like to obtain the pieces for multiple copies of the model, place them in the printed box, and send them to our parents and other extended family as a way to announce the expected arrival of our new little one. 

My question is where would I take the template Ive created to be printed? What material and weight do I use to be a convincing simulacrum of a real LEGO set box?

It was absolutely beautiful, even though we only gave our wedding planner 8 days to pull off the ceremony!! The stars aligned and we were able to enjoy so many things that should have never happened to begin with. 

We decided not to publicly shared the photos since the whole day was so private, that is until our wedding planner was nominated for some awards and we agreed to let her publicize them.  [Heres a link if anyone is interested](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj5srm14fnkAhViLH0KHfYABBUQzPwBegQIARAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stylemepretty.com%2F2019%2F05%2F07%2Fan-emotional-wedding-day-that-reminds-us-all-what-a-wedding-is-truly-about%2F&psig=AOvVaw0mqOHVmPoS8l1tuDSAO6sW&ust=1569974636636800), it has a good rundown with some pictures from the date. All that said, my wife does not have any printed photos from the day and I thought it would be nice to have a book made to commemorate the day in an intimate and discrete way.

Well...now the challenge....Its our first anniversary on this Saturday, Oct. 5th and the person who I paid to create a custom photo book has gone MIA and wont respond after repeated attempts to contact her. Does anyone have a knack for making photo books? I will happily pay for rush service if anyone can make and deliver a nice book by this Friday (latest).

Material ideas for weather-proof homemade Jack-o'-Lanterns?,2,9,"Hi all,

I'm looking at doing my first serious Halloween decorations this year.  I want to have a ""pumpkin"" theme but I live in Australia so we don't really have an abundance of carving pumpkins available.

I'd like to try to make some myself, and if possible be able to re-use them for a year or two.  If that's not possible, I'd at least like them to last a few weeks out in the elements as Halloween decorations (although I could bring them inside when it's raining!)

I've been watching some JennsHaunts on YouTube - she seems to be the pumpkin-making expert.  She makes her base out of papier-mch and then often covers them with clay.  I think I will follow her method for the shape underneath:
https://youtu.be/ZY1yKSUX7Yo

Since I'd like to display my homemade pumpkins outside (and put lights in them), what medium would you recommend?  Some kind of clay?  If so, what kind?

I also want to balance durability with cost.  This is mostly for fun, and I'd like to make quite a few, so I don't want to spend $30 per pumpkin.

Does anyone have any suggestions?  I'm a bit of a craft novice, any help at all would be appreciated!  :)"

I'm a needle crafter, in addition to others ;-), and I want to start photographing my work and see if others like it too.  I totally get sucked into instagram videos of people stitching, and well curated ""threads"" .... pun intended...of beautifully staged works.

Does anyone have tips or suggestions on how to get started?  Types of cameras, lighting, equipment you like?  Also if you are also just a viewer of crafting things like me, would love to hear what you guys like to see as well.  Tutorials or just soothing, soothing stitching...?"

My kids (7 yo daughter, 6 yo son, and 22 month old son) were outside and my 22 month old was collecting them and putting them into a container. When my other kids seen him doing that, they wanted a container as well to put some in. They spent a good while doing this and I would hate to just throw them away or throw them back out into the yard. Does anyone have any ideas on what we could do with them?

I want to display them and be able to see them everyday but I'm not sure how. Do I put them in a collage format? Re-type them on Word with a cute boarder and frame it? (It doesn't have to be the original pieces of paper since some are big with few words on it taking up more space.) He also wrote me a poem a while ago and I want to frame that too, so maybe two frames in a letter format is too much plainness?

I'm having trouble figuring out how to display and frame them since I'm not a creative person and I thought someone from this subreddit could help me. Sorry if this type of thing doesn't belong here (I'm new)!"

I have a started a youtube channel where people can see the items we get and claim them. I am not rich at all but if it can be reasonably shipped I will do it!

"Advice on schoolwide outdoor fabric bunting project (teachers, please help too!!)",3,0,"I am on my daughter's school PTA and as part of our summer fair and event decoration we have strings of fabric bunting which is strung up outside. 

Last summer fair I noticed that the bunting was falling apart and as some of it is 13 years old, I  volunteered to organise a schoolwide project to create new bunting.

Here are the finer details :

1) We are in the UK and the school is underfunded so all supplies have to be paid for out of the PTA savings.

2) The children are aged 2 - 7 (nursery to Year 2).

3)  there are 4 year groups (nursery (4 classes), reception, y1 & y2) and aside from nursery, each year group has 3 separate classes with roughly 30 students per class.

4) The plan was to make 2-3 big banners plus enough bunting to go around the perimeter of the school (I still need to measure that) and so it would be preferable for each of the year groups (aside from nursery) to create a banner, and each child (including nursery) will decorate a triangle.

5) I offered to sew the bunting to the string if need be but I plan to get precut triangles and string/bias tape?? I  don't mind ironing each triangle to set any fabric decor.

6) We are in England and it rains a lot. The bunting has to withstand rain and wind but will only be used a few weeks per year... But I want this bunting to last.  It would also be helpful if it doesn't take too long to dry after rainfall.


Here's what I need help with :

1) What's the best fabric to use for this? Was thinking burlap/hessian but worried it would be hard to decorate. I  am not prepared to hem each triangle.

2) What is the best medium to apply to the triangles that would be weather proof? I'm thinking markers, paint, fabric glue??? I originally thought to steer away from sticking bits on as the old bunting is shedding sequins and felt all over the place.

3) I was hoping to colour code the string somehow so we can easily tell which length of bunting  fits on each section of fence but should each class have a different colour scheme or theme? 

I  want the bunting to look nice and coordinated (and kid created).

4) What's a reasonable amount of decorating medium (paint /markers) per class? I can get sets of paint but I don't know how many each class would need. Also was thinking sets with mainly primary colours are cheaper but that will be glaring bunting... What's the likelihood kids will mix to make another range of colours? 

5) Am I  over thinking this? Is there an easier way?"

Have you ever used Claycrete or Celluclay?,2,1,"Hello! I did a search on this but surprisingly got no hits! I facilitate the art club at my school and were starting a project in which the students make paper mache cake slices. Theyve made the general shape of the slice with cardboard and will now cover it with paper mache. Someone suggested using [claycrete](https://www.dickblick.com/products/amaco-claycrete-instant-papier-m-and-226che/) but it seems expensive. Have you used this product before? It looks great but I cant figure out how much to buy so that each student has enough of it to cover their cake slice. 

Bonus: if you have any ideas for a cheaper alternative I would be so grateful! Im aware of paper strips and flour/water but would like to avoid it because it takes forever to actually do it. However if claycrete is cost prohibitive, we will probably use this method."

I am looking to build a computer desk that:

* Has a monitor mounting arm, or at least supports the weight of an external monitor, I have a curved 24 inch external monitor that I want to mount, I prefer mounting on an ARM instead of just putting it on the desk because mounting makes the monitor sturdier and won't wobble or move a lot when the desk itself is moved.  
* Has some nice tubings for cable management.  
  
I just want you guys to point me in the right direction, I have never done any DIY work in my life so I am inexperienced, but I am willing to follow a tutorial or a guide or look at a blueprint and take my time working on the project. I am not in a hurry even if it takes more than a month.

Type of yarn/tips for crocheting safe cat toys?,1,0,"Hello! First of all, first post on reddit, at least on this account (I don't have almost any access to the email for the old one).

SecondlyI've started to learn to crochet, and I'm thinking of making some nice cat toys for my three cats.

I've noticed one of them LOVES playing with and chewing on string. I don't know if I can give him that perfectly, though I'm trying to get him some rope-based toys (we got him one recently and I immediately accidentally broke it), but I could at least crochet like- thin little tube things with texture, or toys to attach to a cord. Plus a few cute little animal-shaped ones or whatever, which at least he and the babiest cat both like playing with. (I think queen lady-of-the-house cat just does most of her playing when we aren't looking.)

**The question is:**

Are cat toys made from natural yarns (probably cotton, or hemp or bamboo, my mom is allergic to wool so I'm not just going to leave wool cat toys around the house for her) ever safe?

I'm thinking about how they can be bitten apart and swallowed, or come undone- the good news is I'm good at making nice tight stiff stitches.

Are yarns with any % synthetic content safe/in any way sub-optimal for them? Are any actually better?

Do you know of any dyes I should look out for, and/or any brands that avoid dyes that might be harmful? I'm gonna try to support my local knitting shop, so I want to try to buy within their stock and haven't checked it out yet, but also want to know if there are any known health hazards or other rules/tips learned about making cat toys.

Actually, come to think of it, what about safe stuffing? I might experiment with crinkly paper and might make a few unstuffed tubes, but little conventionally stuffed amigurumi toys would be neat too.

Please know you don't gotta answer all of these questions to reply. I'm just putting all of my thoughts out there, and ANY nugget of insight is appreciated."

The toy is a spinning top (Beyblade) so in the long run, I want them to stay on despite the spinning and wind. The stickers are extremely small, some as small as half a small ant or that tiny pimple on your cheek!

Does anyone have any suggestions? Is there a clean glue I can apply to the stickers beforehand perhaps? I don't want to damage anything or destroy the looks. I know nothing about crafts, so any suggestions let me know!"

Question about affixing pressed flowers to a glass frame,2,2,"Hi!

It's my first time here so I hope this is alright to post.

I'm in the process of setting some flowers that I pressed in a clear, double sided frame like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/50/65/76/5065766ede930d89c714cf91e25356c2.jpg). These flowers were pressed from a special occasion so I can't afford to mess it up!

I put them in place and closed the frame, but unfortunately there's too much space between the two panes of glass so they aren't pinned in place, and slide about. I'm thinking I have to glue the flowers to the frame, but I don't know what kind of glue is best to use. I know it needs to dry clear, but all I can find is glue for glass and glue for organic materials, and this needs to work for both! Ideally it would dry so it could be viewed from both sides, but if it ends up needing to be one-sided for practical reasons then that's fine. Is regular superglue alright?

The final piece would hopefully look something like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/60/af/ba/60afbaf446a179e0ab939879a4491b63.jpg) for reference.

Any help and advice would be greatly appreciated!"

I'm not sure if this is expected or what but October is fast approaching and the days are cooling so even in the roasting hot car I'm getting diminishing returns. Any advice?

Plastic fangs/teeth?,2,7,"I'm about to start working on a project( this is the second question I've asked on here about it) and I need fake fangs as part of the decoration on it. I need them to be of varying sizes and each tooth needs to be a different piece. Kind of like the vampire fangs you can find this time of year, but buying enough of those would be a bit pricey, plus they will all be about the same size. I'll need at least twenty fangs so something I could buy in ""bulk"" would be nice. Or if I could make the fangs that would work as well. I'm looking at thermomold right now as an option, but it would be a pain to make them with out a mold. Any one know where I can buy  some or tips on making them?

EDIT: the product is called Thermo*Morph* not mold. It also is called Polymorph as well."

As a kid I used to do some carpenting and [I used one of these ](https://www.bayadaim.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_4082_2_1.jpg) which I really liked, but I can't find anything like it that's got good reviews.

Lastly, I need it to have Metric system and not just Imperial.

Though I'm not even sure if this will be the bast way to go about it. I thought of making a book into the container(it was my first thought) however it would be very hard to find a book the right size and I honestly don't like the idea of ruining a book.

So far, mostly so good, but I've just run into a snag trying to outline stitch and satin stitch the small circles in the bear's paws. Not easy. I've had to pull out my stitches and start over so many times that the felt piece is probably too thin to take any more stitching. Any tips for fixing my mistake? Should I simply trace the piece and cut out a new one? Can I reinforce the thinning area somehow? And, maybe more importantly, any guidance for how to actually make my circles come out looking like circles?"

Is it possible to sand and polish cured hot glue to a shine?,1,2,"Say I want to fill in a open gap on an object with hot glue. When it's fully cooled and cured, is it possible to sand the glue to the shape/flatness I need and then polish it? Aiming for the result of appearing relatively clear/transparent and a smooth plastic like shine and reflectivity. I have a feeling the glue would just quickly load up the sand paper and eventually not produce the desired finish. Any advice on how to get this result or other ideas for similar results? Hot glue is the easiest method that I already have on hand to work with, just never attempted to sand and polish it."

Putting a Velcro back on hand stitched patch,1,4,"Hi all! 

So Im doing CrossFit and I have a military style back back. 

I wanted a company to embroider a patch for me, but all company I found has a 10 pieces minimum. So I looked online how to hand embroider (sorry if its not the right word, English in my second language) a patch. It looks like a fun project!

I have seen satin stitch used a lot, which looks fine by me for the design I will be doing.  Any tips and tricks to make the embroider looks professional and not too much hand stitch ? Like to have clean and equal line ?! I guess to take my time and make sur the line are as straight as I can?! 

My question: what would be the easier way of having a Velcro (hooknloop) back on the patch? 
I do not own a sewing machine. 

Also: I know its hard for you to tell, but I long should I be allowing for hand stitch a patch? I know it depends on the design, but Id like a way to give me an idea! 

Thanks all! 
- from a future first timer!"

How to prevent blisters when using scissors?,2,6,"Whenever I use scissors for extended periods of time, I always seem to end up getting blisters (usually on my index finger first, then my other fingers if I continue). I'm in the middle of a project right now that has me using scissors quite a lot, and I already got a blister on my index finger after only a few hours yesterday. I have it covered with a band-aid right now, but I'm pretty sure if I do more work on it tonight, I'll end up with more. I've thought about putting band-aids on each of my fingers before using the scissors again, but that seems a bit like a waste of band-aids if I do it every time, and I'm not even sure it would work. Does anyone have any tips for avoiding blisters while using scissors?"

Latch hook rug tips?,3,2,"Im moving to a new apt soon and started looking for area rugs but seemed too expensive for the quality so I decided Im gonna make my own. 
Ive never made one but watched a couple tutorials.
I plan to do a plain one since itll be more functional than decorational. 

Does anyone have recommendations on :
- the type of canvas and where I can get a large scale one from? From what Ive seen they come in smaller cut strips
-Im thinking Bernat Blanket Yarn, but Im not sure how to make sure the size yarn will fit in the latch hook or size of the canvas.
-non slip backing
-dos and donts
-should I knot the yarn to the canvas if I want to wash it in the washer or will the regular latch hook be okay

He has some sensory issues, and  there's something about this specific pattern and this specific fabric that makes him happy. When we wash it, it is a devastating 90 minutes. I've tried other fleece blankets with similar colors and they don't work.  I'm wanting to have a backup blanket for sanity's sake, and I can't find it anywhere.  I've tried reverse look-up, and reached out to everyone who got us gifts and no one remembers getting it.  So I'm gonna make one for him!  I found the thread they used on the edging, now I just need the fabric. I'm trying to get a backup so I can be prepared, but can't seem to find anyone who makes it.  I've also had no luck on getting the name of the pattern.  Does anyone know either A) where to find this blanket/fabric? Or B) how I can go about getting a custom image printed onto a fleece fabric?

I don't have a seller's permit from the state. It would take 3 weeks to get approved.

My question is this, based on research I've done, I know that I can legally sell privately and occasionally from my property as a hobby, without remitting sales tax (no different than a garage sale). A craft fair is somewhat scaled up from  there and I think would be in commercial sellers territory (if I sold off all the product I have on hand, which I doubt will happen, I'd have around $3k in sales).

I do have an LLC already from a previous company that I can sell under, but I don't have a seller's permit because that company sold digital, non physical, goods.

Have any of you sold at a craft fair and have you gone through the correct legal channels to obtain a sellers permit in your state?"

however, because we are borrowing lots of set pieces and furniture, i want it all to be easily undone. my idea was to wrap the furniture in some way, like plastic wrap or wrapping paper and then glue on to that, but i dont know how effective that would be. 

what is your advice? what is the best material I could wrap it in?

Need inspiration,4,4,"So I have lost confidence in a lot of things in my life recently. I bought a long canvas to make something for my mother last Christmas, but - due to said loss of confidence - I didnt end up making anything with it. I still really want to use it somehow, but this time to make something for myself. 

Does anyone have any suggestions on something fairly easy that looks nice? I love the acrylic paintings where they use spatulas so theres texture, but I have never even touched a spatula and I really dont have experience with painting on canvas besides the typical wine and canvas parties. I dont want to do something completely abstract because I dont necessarily enjoy that type of art - I want to be able to recognize something in it. 

Also, I love the ocean and sailboats. If anyone has experience with these types of projects or you have any pictures that you think would help inspire, I would truly appreciate it. Just googling things isnt getting me anywhere.

How to prevent paint leaching under tape on concrete?,1,0,"I am working with little square concrete plant pots and Pebeo Mixed media paint, basically paint pouring. 

Obviously since there are multiple sides to do, and since paint pouring requires an excess of paint & a lot of dripping, I have to protect each side with masking tape while I am painting the other sides.

Issue is, as it is an uneven and textured surface, I've noticed a lot of paint leeching under the tape, which is preventing me from getting a flawless finished pot.

I don't know what to do about this! Do I need different tape, or is there a better way?"

It has many memories associated with Japan for me.
[END OF THE STORY]

Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/HGm3jH4

Now... What is the best way to repair it? I am also a perfect newbie with this material. So forgive my newbie wonders. 

Glue could work I guess, but will I still be able to drink with it safely?
So I thought about the Japanese magnifying technique of the kintsugi, working with Golden sheets (and glue I guess).

As you will see on the attached pictures, a small chip broke into many small part, but most of the cup is OK.

Thanks a lot for your kind help!"

Has anyone else noticed that big craft stores are focusing more on home decor and less on actual craft supplies?,71,24,"I've been noticing this trend over the past few years. I feel like big craft giants like Michaels and AC Moore are using up more and more of their space for home decor and ready-made decorations, and less space for, y'know, actual craft supplies.

I just stopped by (or should I say took the time to drive 20 minutes to) Michaels for some plastic needlepoint canvas and unfinished wooden dowels. And they didn't have either in the store. I feel like these are such basic craft supplies that I know they've had for years, and which I've purchased from them before. How do you not have wooden sticks...at a craft store?!

This has been happening to me more and more frequently. Has anyone else noticed this trend? I feel like it's pushing me to shop online from places like Amazon, which I'd rather not support (because of their wasteful packaging and their poor ethics), but it's kind of the only option to get everything I need quickly and in one go."

Here's what I'm asking of you guys; I need some ideas for little arts and crafts the people on this floor could make together and walk away with some really nice memorabilia! The nurses here already like to have little get togethers with the patients since where all in the same boat up here. And what sparked this was how one of the nurses came up with decorating mugs and cooking them to make it permanent. I thought it was really fun and as soon as I'm cancer free I'll be drinking out of it (I wrote I did it! on it). So any quick or easy memorabilia type craft ideas would be amazing!

Thanks!"

A collective craft with a beautiful purpose: my wife's life celebration,17,1,"Hello everybody,

A few months ago I posted here asking for advice. My wife had cancer and I was her primary caretaker. We were spending a lot of time in hospitals and I needed a distraction to help me cope, so I came here asking for help. You all gave me recommendations and I ended up painting rocks. I got a lot of help and support from you guys and a very kind soul even sent me a set of tools to keep nourishing this new hobby. I appreciate it a lot.

My wife died on August 15th. These past few weeks have been an intense emotional, physical, and mental commotion for me. I had to withhold most of my feelings during the two years I was her caretaker, and now the sadness, fear, anger, and pain are coming to me like a force of nature. Luckily, my friends and her friends are carrying me through me, like the true community of love she built for me and for them. Most days I think I won't survive this, but now and then I feel a bit of hope.

Last Saturday we got together and celebrated her life. This is something she asked us to do before dying and I've tried to honor all her wishes as much as I can, even if I'm tired or struggling with her absence. It was a beautiful moment. We built a mandala together using flowers, seeds and beans, and spices. We sang, we danced, we cried, we hugged, we laughed. It was a healing experience.

&#x200B;

>On the day I die, when I'm being  
carried toward the grave, do not weep.  
Do not say, ""He's gone! He's gone!""  
Death has nothing to do with going away.  
The sun sets and the moon sets  
but they are not gone.  
Death is a coming together.

\- Rumi.

Help with instructions for kids craft involving altering images with glue,1,0,"When I was a kid at camp, we did a craft one year where we applied glue to images (nature postcards) and when the glue dried it made it look as though the image was a painting of some kind. 

I tried to reproduce it recently and I seem to have forgotten a step, because it just ended up looking like the original image but slightly glossier. I remember it had a lot more texture when I did it as a kid. 

Does anyone know what this technique is or if there's more to it? I used liquid glue from the dollar store. It was a fairly sketchy camp, so I can't imagine they were using much of their budget on craft supplies. 

&#x200B;

Any help would be greatly appreciated."

High quality card TCG card priting,2,0,"As a present for my partner, I'd like to make a very high-quality, custom, physical Hearthstone card for her (ex:https://i.stack.imgur.com/36ZCl.jpg).

There are 4 main challenges:
1. The art (Solved): I work in video game industry, and will commision an artist to do some custom artwork
2a. The print method: What is a good material/print method to use for a high-quality, firm, product? Ideally, the end result has the same physical properties as a card from any TCG.
2b. Ideally, I want the card to be printed double-sided. Worst-case here is I can print 2 cards (front and back), and find a very good adhesive? Will depend on the materials.
3. The ""shimmering"". This is really a stretch, but is there anyway for the gold to ""shimmer""? Perhaps some after-work with glitter followed by a sealant?

Thanks for any advice, I'm really excited about this project, but am totally lost."

Mini WWI Tribute,1,0,"Greetings,

After watching quite a lot of the Great War youtube channel, I have had WWI on my mind.

It gave me good practice with the different sculpting phases of the material and texturing, and I wanted to share it.  Feedback is most welcome.

Thanks

P.S. I'm not quite sure if this belongs in r/crafts; I trust that the community will let me know.

My first thought was a straight sandwich of a leaf between two pieces of glass/plexi, but even with a firmly  pressed leaf it would be problem with air getting in and not being perfectly flush that could cause issues

My next idea has been using self-levelling resin, poured over a leaf on plexi to seal it and make it flush, and then placing another piece of glass or plexi on top. Haven't tried it yet but before I do, does anyone have any better ideas? I'd like to be able to do some flowers and things to mount them like that."

Advice on what paint/primer/sealer works best on a wood composite box,1,0,"[this was my first attempt](https://imgur.com/a/Jd4U2fc)


Beginner here so please forgive me of my lack of knowledge on available products.

Last week I made this for my brothers wedding and used the following:

-ArtMinds Primer


-Decoart Americana Decor Matte Metallics (in the 8 oz canister)


-Royal &amp; Langnickel 25 piece brush set that were approved for acrylics.

Long story short the primer seemed ok, however, the paint, was the bane of my existence. No exaggeration I was painting layers from 1 pm-3am and as you can see in the image, theres still streaks, unevenness, etc.

I dont know where I went wrong, was it the primer? Is there a better type of paint to use on wood composite than acrylic? Was it the brushes?

Unfortunately I didnt have time to seal this, but I did use sealing spray on plastic frames before and seemed to do the trick, but Im trying to find one best for this type of craft/best even coverage. Potentially not a spray?

Im making a second one for a friend and want to majorly improve. It will be a matte navy blue.

Tips on brands or specific products?!

I often have very creative vision for things outside of music but can't execute due to lack of skill/effort haha. I am hoping someone here can help me out.  I have several handwritten notes that have words of encouragement on them that mean a lot to me. There's probably 20 to 30 different paragraphs that I've received from people over the years, and I would like to turn them into a art piece. It is very important to me that I use the original handwriting from each person. I don't want to simply turn the words into digital text. However, I would like to print some type of photo that has them all combined, and I'm not sure where to start or how to put them all together. The notes are written on different cards, with different backgrounds so when I cut out each note digitally after taking a photo of it, they tend to crash a lot. Are there any tools or ways that I could get just the text and its original form extracted from the background, so that I could take all the words and put them on one big page or photo to print? If there was a better place to post this, please let me know"

3. Can you add the special roller on the Scan and Cut 2 which allows you to cut vinyl longer than 24""?
4. Can you use cricut branded vinyl and transfers in the brother machine?
I know it is a lot of questions, but I cant seem to get real answers elsewhere. Any other feedback between the two is welcome!

Does anyone have tips/advice on epoxy resin casting?,1,4,"Im a gardener (mostly flowers) and Im about to start selling my plants at local farmers markets in the next few weeks. 

I have been pressing flowers since Ive been growing them, so I have books and books full of pressed flowers. In search of a unique way to use them, I eventually settled on resin casting. 

Ive already bought two brands of epoxy resin (clear) to figure out which I like the best, mold release spray, various molds, and Im waiting for a spray for the flowers to be delivered because I couldnt find it in the store.

Experienced resin casters out there - any advice before I embark on my experimentation?

I really want it to be crystal clear, too, whats the best way I can achieve that?"

Does it ever get old when people ask you to make things for them?,13,6,"I mainly crochet and cross stitch. Ive gotten pretty good, and I have a lot of wearable stuff and things all over my home that Ive made. 

And dont get me wrong, I love doing it! But I feel like when friends and family ask me to make something for them, they dont take into consideration how long its going to take and all of the work that goes into it. Usually I just ask that whoever wants something pays for the materials, and then guess what? Nobody wants to spend $100 on that queen size cabled blanket, but they didnt mind asking me to do it as a favor for them for free. 99% of the time I just chalk it up to they didnt realize how much it would cost, which is fair because yarn for bigger projects can be expensive. 

It also can be difficult finding a pattern for someone. Normally its just I want x can you make it, so then I have to either hunt for or make the pattern for whatever they want. And then making the pattern is a whole other headache. 

So far I have 7 requests for laptop cases after I brought mine with me a few places. Mine is a simple C2C, and that didnt take long at all. But Im just not looking forward to doing a bunch of multiple color laptop cases, because thats all anyone wants. My aunt wants me to make little Christmas stocking for her entire third grade class this year. A friend wants me to cross stitch a Pokmon for them but ONLY with a super detailed picture that took two hours to fix up and will end up being like 25x28 inchs when Im done. 

So I want to know if its just me, or does crafting on command get a little old for everyone else?"

We are planning on making pillow cases to be donated to the pediatric wing of the hospital and blankets and duffel bags to be donated to DCFS and the Children's Advocacy Center, among other organizations.  

We need any and every kind of fabric, including canvas, upholstery, and other heavy-duty fabrics (to make duffel bags).  Any size pieces (bigger than just scraps) are welcome, and I am happy to drive to you (up to 6ish-hours each way from North-Central Arkansas, so that includes St. Louis, KC, OKC, Dallas, Shreveport, Jackson, Birmingham, and Nashville) to pick it up!  We also need notions (thread, bobbins, rotary cutters, cutting mats, etc.) if you have extras of those.

Please feel free to share this far and wide (well, within a 6-hour drive of Batesville).  If you have a hoard you'd like me to pick up, you can message me on here or email me at mary.saczawa\[at\]lyon.edu.  Service day is October 23, so the sooner the better!"

Looking for a crafting/MacGuyver kind of solution,2,3,"Not sure if this would be sub to post this in, but my parents had ordered the incorrect rolls of credit card paper for our machine. The rolls' width is fine, but it's the amount that's the problem. They fit if they're whittled down to half their size by hand-spooling to a previously used black, plastic credit card roll. I was thinking if we had something like what they use for silk, like having two rolls on sticks to hold them up and using a hand crank to spin it until they both reach half of the total, while also keeping it aligned so there only needs to be minimal adjustment to straighten it out... 

Sounds like it's a lot of work for something so seemingly trivial, but we have an entire box worth of credit card rolls and we just ran out of the last one that was fixed by hand. I'd appreciate any thoughts on how to go about doing this.. The only way that pops up in mind is having the three components (crank and two rolls on fitted sticks) be linked together by gears somehow. I was initially thinking of it would be made of wood, but if it's possible to just buy metal parts that could be put together to make something that'll function, I'd be all for that.

Tips and recommendations for denim painting,1,1,"Hi all,

Hoping to run into a few wise and helpful souls here, I am a complete beginner and would like to paint the back of a denim jacket. 

Nothing crazy or detailed, couple of white stripes will do but I have no idea where to start as I have never done this before (ok might have tried my luck with a few felt pens in my youth, as you can imagine it never amounted to anything!) 

Is there anything I need to do to prep the jacket itself prior to painting it in order to ensure that the paint takes? Any undercoat/overcoat? Particular brand of quality paint?

Ill take any advice!

Thanks so much"

Thinking about getting into polymer clay,3,8,"Does anyone have any advice or know any newbie diy links for polymer clay? I'm really into these cute kawaii charms and jewelry. 

All of my crafting experience has been based on stencils, modge podge, and painting furniture. And renovating dollhouses. I am truly new to this type of craft. Any and all tips and advice would be appreciated. I just have a lot of free time for the next year or so. My husband is in his final year of school and I work very part time in order to deal with our daughter's therapies. She was diagnosed with autism a few months ago. My husband also picked up a second job to get insurance to help pay for our daughter's therapy. 

So yes, I'm also open to any other crafting type activity that's inexpensive, not too artistic in skills (I'm not great at drawing), and relaxing because my life is a tiny bit of a crazy hot mess at the moment and keeping my mind busy is best. 

Thanks everyone!"

Mid-century modern lounge chair,1,0," Hello!

Today I want to share the process of creating a mid-century modern lounge chair.

It all started with a model in sketchup

https://i.redd.it/rsvfb4seo7k31.jpg

Then he started to make a seat

https://i.redd.it/p7aovljfo7k31.jpg

And the back. All assembled on a mortise and tenon connection

https://i.redd.it/bw9u4rggo7k31.jpg

First look

https://i.redd.it/up1frq8ho7k31.jpg

Then from the scraps I began to pick up a template for the legs. The seat has been raised to the properly height

https://i.redd.it/bhcc2v2io7k31.jpg

Legs

https://i.redd.it/in9o7uzio7k31.jpg

Next were added the structural elements

https://i.redd.it/e2s94vnko7k31.jpg

Gluing all parts together!

https://i.redd.it/ye0eu9qlo7k31.jpg

Cushions are also made by hand from dense foam rubber. The fabric was selected in contrast to the pinkish color of beech.

https://i.redd.it/p2zkj0jmo7k31.jpg

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/ymukv4hno7k31.jpg

Materials:

\- beech

\- oak and maple for insert on the back

\- water-based matt polyurethane varnish for topcoat

&#x200B;

The whole process of creating a chair can be seen in the video:

It seems that Mod Podge is a better choice for fabrics, but am afraid that as the fabric and glue sits in the mold, it still won't dry because there's too much moisture. Any help would be super appreciated!"

Seems like mastic would also work well for tree trunks or other rough texture surfaces while adding durability.  The mastic is water based and doesnt seem to be overly toxic while dried, especially considering its usually used for AC ducts that push air around buildings."

Enjoy!

I printed the box on a cereal box. If you do, make sure to print the box outer to something like 108% and the inner to like 106% to account for the thickness of your cereal cardboard.

Fair warning: Building pnp MW took me about 3 evenings so that is about 12 hours, by buying the product instead you save yourself an hourly wage of $2.50 per hour.

On the plus side, pnp are indestructible and you can take your pnp on holidays or hotel nights for business travel. If you really like it AND intend to play it more you can always buy the 2nd edition from the creators."

Need advice on how much cloth to get,2,4,"I'm not sure if you guys answer questions like this one, so if you don't just let me know and I'll delete it.

I'm planing on making Halloween costumes for my dogs this year. I know what I want them to be, but unfortunately I can't find anywhere that sells the costumes and the one place I did find is on Etsy but sadly a bit too out of my price range. I had made a costume for one of them previously for a walk/run/costume contest, so I'm not worried about figuring out how to make it. My issue is trying to figure out how much cloth I'll need to buy for them. It was easier before when I was only making a costume for one (I actually have some extra left over that I'm trying to figure out what to do with), but I'm not sure how much more I need to get for them both. The one I didn't make one for previously is a bit smaller, but not much more than the other, so should I double the amount of cloth, or does it depend on what type of cloth I use? I had used nylon before, but I'm thinking of using something thicker that can still stretch to allow movement, since I only used nylon because it was Summer and I didn't want him overheating. I'm open to any ideas or help that anyone is willing to give!"

Wanting to put a design permanently on a t-shirt.

Now its all I think about lol. My question is: without buying an expensive kit or circut machine, whats the best way to permanently put a small (~2x2) opaque symbol onto a t-shirt?

My canvas is a 12x12x2 box. In order to get the depth id want i need to have a bit of resin built up first. it would take 32oz just to reach a decent depth and buying 32oz of resin just to get the base done seems wasteful. Is there any material I can use to take up space while remaining invisible in the resin? I tried some thick plexiglass but the edges are still visible, maybe if I cut it to an exact size it may work but anyone have any better ideas?"

I ordered a Tecre kit online from the company, and was supposed to have it shipped to my location. Unfortunately, due to an error on my part, it's not going to arrive in time for the convention. Amazon can get me a button maker by tomorrow, but mophorn machines are pretty pricey for what I hear are pretty bad machines.

I'm aiming for $50 and under, which I know is a huge ask. It can be a child's button maker for all I care - my one criteria is that it needs to be able to survive a two-day convention.

I have other things to sell, so it wouldn't be the end of the world, but I'd definitely like to use these button designs.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!"

I haven't had any luck unloading them on eBay and I can't find any non-chain craft stores nearby (I imagine chains have their own sources).

Are there other, better avenues I should be exploring? Could I buy a table at a crafts fair and sell them there, or are you expected to just sell your _own_ creations? Are there wholesalers that might take them off my hands? Do wedding decorators take solicitations?

I'd love _any_ advice or insight that could help me rid myself of this albatross that I've had around my neck for over a year now. Thank you!"

Best weighted copy paper for inkjet photo transfers to canvas?,1,0,"I recently did a inkjet photo transfer on 20 lb copy paper, which turned out a bit dim but acceptable and also left a very thin layer of paper after I scrubbed the surface off. I managed to get underneath some of the thin layer that was left but I saw that I was also lifting the printed image. I'm guessing it has to do with the weight of the copy paper?

How can I best replicate the texture and color of the bark of an oak tree to make a weather-proof fake oak log?,1,0,"Hey crafties, if you wanted to craft yourself a smallish imitation oak log/trunk that could live outside in the weather, what products and materials and tools would you use to get the 3D texture and colors of it? 

I don't want to use a real log because [reasons that would unnecessarily distract us from our purpose here]

I've got a tube and want to slather/encrust its outside with some kind of product or products that will be able to live out in the heat and cold and rain and humidity and then paint/texture it in some matte way that looks reasonably decent and blends in and also survives the weather.

Check out [this album of photos](https://imgur.com/a/VFlRloR) to see what I want to replicate. How would you go about creating this bark effect, creative/handy people?"

Durability of Resin crafts,1,0,I saw a local artist that makes broken glass mosaics with resin on old glass panels. I asked about if making a custom one for our front door glass panel and if it would yellow in the sun. They said they had done an old door before and that it would not yellow in the sun as there other projects had not. After looking into this type of craft project I have seen a lot of warnings about resin crafts being exposed to sun and even heat so I am not sure this type of method can be used on doors exposed to all the elements. Does anyone have experience with this type of stuff or know the limitations? Even if there are certain questions I should ask as it sounds like they have not been making these for very long.

Best option to haul craft show booth/display and products,1,5,"Hello,

I am getting ready to start a busy season of craft shows and am looking for a new solution to getting all of my items across town.  Last season I had a smaller display and less products and was able to get it all into my car (2013 Honda Fit).  This season, I have more stuff and it won't all fit for the one trip I need it to be based on time/distance for setting up these displays.  

According to the manufacturer, my car isn't rated to pull any kind of trailer.  However, according to U-Haul, my car would be able to haul a small trailer that I could pack all of my items in and move everything in one trip.

I'm trying to do this in the most economical way possible and I'm not sure the best route to take as there are so many possibilities.  Does anyone else have experience with this?  What do you use to get your products/displays to and from shows?

Thanks!"

I'm in the UK, so if any of you know any stores or ways I can get decent wood reasonably cheap, then that'd be great. 
I'm not too fussy about what kind of wood it is, but it needs to be at least 2 inches thick, I can only find like 0.6mm thick veneers.

Help With Tie-Dye or Dip Dye,2,0,"Hello, lovely people. I have a question for you.
My husband and I got married 3 years ago. I bought an absolutely gorgeous Vera Wang dress and I love it. I love it so much that it makes me sad to see it having no further use and just taking up closer space. We are big fans of the renaissance festival near our home and go multiple times every year. So I had the idea to tie-dye or dip dye my dress and turn it into a fairy costume. The material is satin with a tulle overlay. I was thinking about leaving the tulle white and placing LED lights between the color layer and the tulle layer. So my question is, what is the best way to dye the satin? I've watched a few videos and done some googling but can't seem to find a consensus on the best way to do so. And, of course, I don't want to experiment on my dress so I'll be making trial runs before I make that step. 
Thoughts? Tips? Tricks? Please help me. Thanks in advance!"

UV Resin vs Hot Glue for Adhesive,1,1,"I was getting ready to start using my new UV resin to bond glass and metal for jewelry (and cork and glass) when I saw a video stating that UV isn't *actually* meant for adhesive purposes, just filling/doming/casting. Ironically you can often see uv resin advertised as glue because of its quick cure time via uv light. Is there any truth to this or does it just depend on the materials you're trying to cure together? I want to get a second opinion before I experiment with liquid filled glass and end up with a huge mess."

Two part silicone and urethane liquids are a bit too expensive for me right now, so looking into other methods. A much cheaper method involves breaking down silicone caulk with mineral spirits or anything with naphtha  I think and will eventually dry so I can use the mold as intended. BUT I just realized that since this will be used for candle making, and a flammable, combustible liquid was used to create the mold, could there be a problem using liquid wax that reaches roughly 200 degrees with with this kind of mold?"

Desperate for help with my graduation shadow boxes!,1,1,"Hi Reddit! I'm trying to preserve my high school and college graduation caps and tassels in shadow boxes, and the internet has been surprisingly unhelpful. 

For my high school box (http://imgur.com/a/hiT8qxy), I'm wondering if I should get a bigger box; the box pictured is an 1114. I'm afraid of too much empty space. Should I get a different box with a dark background to offset the white? 

When it comes to the college stuff (http://imgur.com/a/GqvZ2aI), my first priority is finding a way to preserve the letters and gems and that have started falling off the cap. Is there something I can spray on there? I definitely need a bigger box for them. How should I arrange everything inside the box?

Final question: how do I mount stuff to the box?

TIA!"

Can I sandwich resin between two solid layers?,1,1,"Hi r/crafts,

I'm completely new to using resin and I've been looking at tutorials and tips on working with it. I've had an idea for a project utilising resin between what is essentially two slabs of wood (30cm long, 11cm wide, 1cm deep) so the end goal is a solid layer, a clear resin layer and another solid, wood layer. In the end I'd like it to be one 3cm deep block.

What I'm after is guidance on whether it's possible to 'sandwich' a layer of resin between two wood slabs like this, and if I can put the wood layer on top and ideally have it all stick together without the need to join it with screws etc.

Having done some searching about layering, all I'm really finding is tips on multiple layers of resin on top of one another, but that's not really what I'm after.

If someone can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated!"

They're pretty special to me because I'm planning on changing careers soon, and I can imagine being an old lady looking at them and remembering my misspent youth.   


I'm wondering if anyone has any cool ideas for what I could do with them or how I could display them? At work, we have a full wall of them from every show and it looks sick, but I live in rented accomodation and don't really have any furniture to my name (although I would be willing to purchase something portable). I'd want it to be something I could take with me when I move house, but equally it would be cool if I wasn't just sticking them to a photoframe or piece of wood.

"Hey crafty people, I need help",2,10,"So here's the issue: I used vaping to quit smoking, but now I can't stop vaping... quitting that is even harder, so I needed something relatively mindless/meditative to keep my hands busy. I liked crochet because I could make stuff for my kid, but I was only able to make her an ok-ish scarf because I SUCK at crochet. I'm really not a crafty/artsy person in general. Crafting in general is something I'd like to get good at, but I can't ever get the hang of anything and I end up with an aversion to it. So...I need something kinda easy. Any suggestions would be extremely helpful. Thank you!!

(672) underneath it, and maybe the corresponding numbers in Japanese as well. 

My question is - Ive read a few methods of preserving leaves (glycerin, pressing, etc) is there a method that in your opinion works best?

Repurposing Menswear Fabric Swatches; Any Ideas?,1,0,"Hello! I work in custom menswear and for years have seen hundreds of swatches of some of the worlds finest wools get thrown away at the end of every season. Most of these fabrics are wool, or wool blends, are between 3"" x 5"" and 4"" by 8"", and are unfinished at their ends. Does anyone here have an idea of how to effectively up-cycle or reuse these swatches? What would I need to qualify a particular piece of cloth for use in another project? Thanks in advance!"

I'm not sure how to go about it and was looking for advice/tips. I was thinking of getting a scrapbook with the page protectors (like in photo albums) and using card stock. I would stencil on the uppercase and lowercase letters in the middle (i.e. B is for book, banana, and bottle) and then draw those items on the page. I was also thinking that if I used the page protectors, I could also have cut outs of those items to make it interactive. 

Anyone got any tips or ideas? Also, I need help coming up with good, simple words to go with each letter."

So I am a fashion designer who works with sequin fabric. I've collected all the discarded sequins that pop off or are cut off the fabric over the past year. I want to create a painting with them by mixing them into a clear paint of some sort. Ideally I'd like to put layer onto layer so it is dimensional and reflects light.

I found some clear clay through google but it looked like the people in the reviews were using it for slime so I'm guessing that's not what I'm looking for."

6 Podcasts I Watch While Knitting and Crocheting,4,0,"   
I started a series on my blog called [""My Favorites""](https://dezzyloops.blogspot.com/2019/08/6-podcasts-i-watch-while-knitting-and.html) and starting the series off is podcasts.  
  
In no particular order, I listed the 6 podcasts I usually watch and also included a new podcaster I found as a bonus number 7.   
  
There were so many people that I wanted to add but I knew the blog post would be about 3 days worth of reading.

UV Resin troubles?,3,1,"I'm very new to crafting and even newer to using UV Resin, which I decided to try after the cure time of regular art resin became a bit too stressful to work under. I like a resin that allows me to perfect little details in the design as long as I care to before curing.

At the moment I'm attempting to dome some basic circle pendants, just metal backings with a printed image inside. The trouble I'm having is that when I hold my UV light over it, the resin warps and lifts up away from the backing plate. I end up with basically a hard resin bowl sitting in the center of my backing plate.

The resin also smokes/steams quite a bit when curing. I've considered that maybe the UV flashlight I got for this purpose is too strong? Could it be causing warping by curing too quickly? Has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution?"
"Tried something new today. This one has a hole in the canvas so the crystals can be put in it. This is a ""Geode"" over an acrylic pour. I cant use resin, because I have pets in the home. Needs one more clear coat, but I'm happy with it.",24,4,

Advice Wanted -- Leaving a negative review,5,7,"Okay, guys, I need some advice. For once I'm on the buyer side, not  the crafter side, I'm about to leave my first negative review ever on an Etsy purchase. I want to make sure I'm being fair.

I purchased a \~$120 branding package, which at the time included a PDF/PNG/PSD/AI  files of a custom-made main logo, two sublogos, some fonts, and a color  scheme/palette. I am paraphrasing as after I purchased it and had paid,  she altered the description of the Branding Package to no longer include AI files, fonts, or colors. I wish I had screenshotted it after I purchased, but I didn't realize that shop owners could alter descriptions after the fact.

The artwork she made for my logo was lovely, and absolutely met the specifications I gave, so that's why I'm not going to leave a 1-star review.

However, when it came time to deliver my final products, the PSD for the main logo, the fonts, and the color palette were all missing. (The AIs were missing too, but I didn't really need/care about  those so whatever)

When I pointed out that PSDs, fonts, and a color scheme had been included when I paid, she apologized and sent the  missing PSD, but still no fonts or color palette. In addition, because I  was missing the fonts, I couldn't use the PSDs.

When I  indicated, again, that I hadn't received what I had paid for, I was given the name of a single font that will cost me an additional $15-$20, and a hexcode for a single color instead of a palette of colors that would work well together.

Right now I'm angry. I'm debating  between giving her two stars, or three stars. I feel more like two  stars, but I want to be fair and I know that I'm not always fair when I'm angry."

Sealing my vehicle's vinyl window decals with what?,2,4,"Hi I am looking to make my window decals a bit more resistant to the elements. Can I use clearcoat paint so feather the edges of my die cut vinyl to keep them from peeling?

I used cricut permanent vinyl because it came in a long roll which I needed to cut long decals. 

I would have used oracal651 permanent but my local Michael's only have 12x12 inch sheets. So I used cricut permanent vinyl glossy from a 12x48inch roll. 

I've read good reviews but am looking to solidify my results a bit better. 

The decals on my window are letters and an 8 inch logo. 

I dont want to buy more product than I have to because I'm not really doing more crafting so am looking for a more commonly-found alternative. 

If I have to go buy some mod podge then okay I'll go get a small bottle. 

Thoughts?"

Im not really sure how to go about this. I know the basics of sewing, but Im definitely a beginner (Most of my limited knowledge is in embroidery). I was thinking the best way to do it would be as a mini quilt of sorts? Cut out 20 little triangles and stitch them together until I can stuff it and attach something to hang it with. Is this feasible? Feel free to tell me if this is impossible!

Proofread me on making of a Boombox,1,0,"I decided to get myself into electronics and maybe audio stuff, so I decided to make myself a boombox just because I can and maybe sell it afterwards due to lack of use. I just never messed with audio and acting by whatever guides I found on (your favourite search engine) and not really confident on what I need there. 

What I'm planning to do: Invade aliexpress for suitcase, amp, speakers, some electronics and whatnot and clob it together with mad skillz and hire an artist to draw a yellowjacket's face on front. I want to make it to the best of my ability(and drawing is horrendous. that's why I'll outsorce it).

Features: at least 24h of ""party time"", bluetooth, full range audio(more below), volume/bass/trebble controller, 12V power socket, robust 220V(like in PC cases), battery charge indicator, metal grilles so nobody pokes a hole in my speakers.

What I came up with speakers: 2\*1.5 10W tweeters, 2\*3"" 20W full range, 2\*4"" 15W woofers and 5.25"" 50W subwoofer, all arranged [about like this](https://imgur.com/brhVRFY). Gray box is the side of the suitcase( 37x28,5x8 cm so the board is \~35x27 cm) where speakers will be installed. Idea is to give full range around and dedicated tweeters/woofers scoop where full range missed and add to overall volume

The amp board has L and R channels, 50W for each and 80W for subwoofer, so I guess I'm not exceeding the budget in terms of power. Might add simple crossovers to tweeters and others if needed. 

Battery will be ether a brick or two like those installed in UPSs or many smaller batteries soldered together. All of that will be linked to power controller board that manages charging and giving outputs for 12 and 5 volts. 

Bluetooth+next/prev/stop/play buttons will be provided by a board with arduino nano+wifi module+couple of buttons(aliexpress sells things like those that are ready to go out of the box)

What do you think? Is it too overkill somewhere? missed something?"

I am looking to put together a fancy presentation of the gifts I am bringing to my friends bridal shower, however there is one massive problem.

How do you find gift boxes for items weighing 5-10lbs? (Things like glass bowls and the like). My friends registry was on Zola and they do not do gift boxes or wrapping, so everything arrived in a brown shipping box. I have been searching the internet for gift boxes that would support the weight of her registry items, however all the ones I think might work just end up bottoming out because the boxes are too thin and flimsy.

Has anyone had this issue before? Can anyone recommend gift boxes not made out of flimsy paper products?"

Ideas for a mini arcade cabinet craft?,1,2,"Hi everyone,

My friend's birthday is coming up, and I'm going to be setting up a Raspberry Pi for him with MAME and some other retro emulators on there. 

I had the idea of making a mini arcade cabinet for it to sit in, but I'm not sure what materials or methods I should use to make this. A very crude way of doing it would be cardboard, hot glue and some colored sharpies for decorating. 

Does anyone have any better ideas of what I should do? I'm not super handy and I don't feel comfortable making it out of wood or metal since I don't have the required tools. Any suggestions would be appreciated, thank you!!

I feel bad not having anything to put on those pages because we had two showers for my son, so his pages are filled out. We're now having a girl, but the only thing we needed is clothes, and Ive already bought those.  
I thought about either taking pictures of things I've purchased for her to add to those pages or maybe just using them for more pictures of her as she grows. Just wondering if anyone else has run into this and has some good ideas?"

How to remove Marvy Permanent Fabric Marker (AKA The story of a very unfortunate sweatshirt),1,7,"Is there any way to remove this marker from fabric as it's intended to be permanent? Should I try paint thinner, bleach, hydrogen peroxide or what?

This is yet another misstep in a hilariously tragic journey of trying to fix an accidental bleach stain on a sweatshirt...

I have tried both coloring the bleached spot darker, so it wouldn't be noticeable, and removing color from around the spot with the same intention. Now for the second time I'm trying to re-dye it and now I've gotten most of the dye I used last time as well as the original color out of the garment, and all that remains is that damned fabric marker on the spots that used to be bleached, and are now darker than the rest. 

I'm afraid that if I try to dye it all over now those spots will still remain darker, so I'm trying to remove the permanent marker and hoping that I could get the spot reach the same tone as the rest of the fabric, so I could dye it again, because its color was what I liked about it the most from the start, so that's what I'm desperately trying to get back.

I'm a little concerned what will be left of the shirt after all these bleaches, hot washes etc. I already fixes one hole that probably came in the washing machine. Soon I've probably also splurged the price of a similar new garment to all these dyes and bleaches.

I hope to get some encouraging advice how to continue as there's no turning back now, and I also hope someone could learn from my mistakes."

What can I do to make the edges smooth?

I machine sew them with a short stitch length. I wonder if maybe my actual circle isn't good enough, or if it is natural from the stuffing, or if there is something I am missing.  Any ideas?

New to candle making as a hobby looking for advice and discussion with fellow candle makers.,3,1,"Hello fellow candle makers. My wife, daughter, and I have recently started making candles as a hobby and working on perfecting them now. We started about 6 months ago, but quickly got discouraged. With the amount of different combos(wicks, wax, jars, pour temp, etc), trial/error period, and how time consuming it would be to perfect everything.  All while working, raising 4 kids, etc. We want to start back working on candles because we really enjoy working on them and the process. We have decided to just be patient and not rush things now. 

We are using gb 444 soy wax, adding the fragrance oil(from Aztec) at 175 degrees and pouring at 130-135 degrees. Weve done a few at 8%, 10%, and 12%. We have used standard 4oz mason jars and 8oz patio jars. We have been using Premier Wicks WI-767 6 1/2 Inches wicks for both jars. It was the recommended wick on our initial purchase from Aztec to use with the 8oz jars. The wicks didnt seem to be strong enough for the 8oz jars, but seem perfect for the little 4oz jars. We have only made about 20 candles in total. We have let them cure for 24hrs, 48hrs, 72hrs, 1 week, and 2 weeks. The cold throw is great, but no matter how long the cure time is or how much FO is added the hot throw isnt very strong at all. Is there another wax like paraffin we can mix with the 444 to help with the scent throw or should we use a different blend all together? We have 50 lbs of the 444 soy wax. We will be purchasing more fragrance oils, jars and wicks within the next week or so because we have ran out of all 3. Any recommendations there?

Also we are looking for any advice, personal experiences, tips, tricks, combos, cure times, recommended fragrance oils or fragrance oil companies, different jars, adding color or anything else that will help us perfect our candlemaking.  

Please feel free to comment. I would love to hear from some experienced candle makers and learn a lot. I plan to be very active in this sub-Reddit and I will post our progress along the way. Thank you all so much in advance.

Where Can I Buy a Polarizing Lens Sheet: Making Shades for My Buddies' Band,2,1,"So my buddies want to make custom sunglasses for their hometown metal band show and I have the design up and running, but I hit a snag: I can't seem to find anywhere that sells half decent sheets of polarized lens material or whatever it's called.

Can someone help point me in the right direction?

Also on-topic but unrelated to the lenses, I am debating on using a custom mold I have for the frames or using a 3D printer to model and print them out. What would you suggest if, possibly, I start selling limited ones for my buddies' band in the future?"

Craft Room Organization!,2,1,"https://i.redd.it/9nps9x4hl5e31.jpg

Yarn pic is just a distraction. :) So I am going to attempt for the thousandth time to organize my craft/storage room so that it is usable but also organized.  The problem is I can make it sort of organized but then it doesn't feel usable. Currently I have a ton  (like 15) large clear plastic tubs, quite a few medium sized tubs and lots of small ones too and I have them on shelves. I also have peg board that I am going to attempt to attach to the sides of these shelves.

I need to have a space for quite a few crafts. I sew(2 sewing machines: one standard sized brother and an antique table machine), knit, crochet, weave (i have a medium sized 36"" 4 harness loom and a small table top cricket), spin(an ashford traveler), cross stitch(way too many scroll frames with wips attached, and way too many brands of floss) and also I need a technology spot for my laptop, printer and 3d printer.

Please share photos/ideas you have had to get any of these crafts organized so I can try and frankenstein a room together. Maybe I just need less hobbies."

Putty style stuff that sticks to styrofoam - what to use!?,3,2,"Hi Reddit!  


I'm making a video for the video, I need to have a face moulded onto a styrofoam head, like a layer of skin. The head is one of those standard styrofoam wig/sunglasses modelling heads. It's made from this because behind the face a whole lot of shapes/things have been cut into it/added to it that suited the material.

The thing is, I need to mold a face onto it as part of the video, like someone carving a clay face, but massaging it into the already present contours of the head. PRoblem is, I'm struggling to find something that actually will stick/stay on the styrofoam. So far I've tried a conventional ""Play Doh"" and Plasticine.   


Any other ideas? It might be easier to know that the shoot will use two heads - one will have the face already pre constructed (so if it hardens/sticks to it, that's fine) before the filming takes place - the final head.

 The shoot will show the construction of the ""final head"", but using a different one (identical styrofoam head) and molding the stuff to it. So it doesn't have to be sturdy/a material that will be molded to it, and stay perfectly. It's transitional to the final cut.  It also doesn't matter if it looks a bit shit (that's the idea). 

Keep in mind this is a low low budget, skeleton crew production. Was considering looking into getting something made with latext etc but its just not going to fit into the project."

I'm a big arts and crafts person and I dabble in EVERYTHING. I'm moving out of the house I've lived in for 20ish years. The house I'm currently in has a massive craft room that is full of literally everything you can imagine. 

Its stuffed to the gills with 20+ years of crafting supplies. I'm starting to go through and throw things out/donate/organize because it's a crazy mess. Has anyone else moved and dealt with trying to move crafting supplies? What tips/tricks did you use? I'm trying to sort everything out and group it by Ziploc, but I'm not sure if there's a better way? Just looking for some advice if anyone else has had to move all their stuff! Thanks:)"

Metal would have much the same result. If you have a suggestion for making it bond as if it's paper, I'd love to hear it. I've considered scoring/sanding, but that can't be enough, I'm sure.

DIY Cement Planter & Sculpture mold tips?,1,5,"Hi everyone,

This weekend, I'm going to make a cement planter to put a succulent garden in as a house warming gift for my boyfriend because he's moving into a new apartment. He skateboards, and I was thinking about making a mini ramp sculpture out of the cement to place in the middle of the pot and surround with succulents. 

What would be the best way to make a cement mold to get the curve of the ramp? I was going to buy or construct a rectangle mold for the base and use a cut plastic cup to press into the center to make a ramp shape? Does anyone have any better suggestions for constructing the ramp?

I was also going to paint the dried cement pot and the ramp with famous graffiti/murals from his skate park. Does acrylic work well on cement? And what is the best way to paint over the texture of cement if it gets a little cracked/bumpy from air bubbles?"

Advice needed: giant engagement ring?,1,2,"Hello!

&#x200B;

At my wedding next summer, we want our ringbearer to carry a giant engagement ring down the aisle. I've seen some cute inflatable ones, but I'm not 100% sold on the idea of an inflatable. I feel like I could do it better/classier/more impressively. I've seen some GIANT ones - as in they're made for people to float in - but he's only three years old and it might be difficult for him to carry one THAT large.

&#x200B;

So, really, ultimately, I am hoping to craft something. I keep going back to the thought of a wreath ring/form for the ring part, painted gold, but I don't get further than that when I brainstorm. How would you guys go about making a large engagement ring that is holdable for small hands? It might be cute to have one engagement ring and one regular band (entwined??? but how to do that???) but I'd be happy with just the engagement ring one if it came down to it. It's just for the aisle walk/pictures to be cute/unique/funny.

&#x200B;

Thanks!"

I've looked up some methods of how I can do it at home, but the only accessible option seems to be iron-on transfer paper and or DIY screen-printing, which looks cheap. I would also definitely be willing to spend money to get professional companies to print the design out for me, but I am struggling to find affordable companies.

Where in the US or online can i buy craft foam?,1,8,"I'm working on making a block or a hat that I'm making, and a lot of people on YouTube have suggested using craft foam because wooden hat blocks are very expensive.  Trouble is, i cant seem to find any online.  

The foam is like a dense, non flaky styro foam thats I guess usually light blue.  The video I saw the guy had a big sheet of it that was fairly thick.  I need mine to be about 5"" thick.  Another dilemma is none of these guys have posted in forever so asking them is out.  The only store i could think to look at is hobby lobby but they only had normal styro foam.

Anyone know of a site or store that sells it?  Maybe its not called craft foam at all."

Car scents,1,3,"Had an idea today, going to see if it works:

1) found a stylish pepper shaker, clear glass with a screw on lid.

2) filled it with scented wax cubes of my favorite scent

3) tied a string to the neck portion

4) screws cap on tight

5) hung from my rear view mirror in the car


Thought:  

The heat from being parked in the sun in the summer or from the windshield defogger in the winter melt the wax to release the scent.

Why: 

Cost- pepper shaker about $1.20 wax cubes about $0.30/ea times 3 = $2.10 total...

Wax cubes last months in my house, and ""refills"" are a cheap $0.90/ea in literally any scent I can find. Probably cost less if bought in bulk online. 

Would appreciate feedback / replicated experiences info."

"Does Anyone Do Squishy Makeovers? Help, Quick Question on Paint",1,0,"Hi there. My daughter is really into watching videos of squishy makeovers, so I thought it would be a fun summer project. 


Anyway, I'm having a problem with them still being kind of ""sticky"" after they dry. The fabric paint is dry, as in you can squish it without getting on your hands, but if you happen to put 2 of them next to each other they will stick together. Or they will stick to really smooth surfaces like a granite table or hard plastic.


Is there some kind of coating I can either spray on or brush on? I'm guessing I couldn't use mod podge or clear acrylic because they would crack when you squished them. Help?

I'm using a combination of the Tulip Slick paint and the generic fabric paint at Michael's - just depending on which color I use. TIA!"

"Does anyone have any ideas for preserving something like seaweed to maintain its flexible movement. I'm an art fabricator and we'd like to hang and preserve a bunch of seaweed, and have it swing. Dipping in resin, plastic before it dries? Anyone tried anything similar? Thanks for any input.",1,5,"I work for an artist, and we're creating a sort of underwater vibe inside, hanging a shit ton of seaweed from ""waving/moving"" panels above you so it feels like you're underwater. The room is lined in huge mirrors, so it'll feel like its endless waves of seaweed. 

We dont want to use fake plastic seaweed. We love the real stuff we got from LA beaches, but it dries out and becomes pretty stiff, as you would expect. 

Is there anyway or ideas people have to preserve this elasticity or movement? I was gonna try dipping it in resin before it dries out? Or another plastic or non-porous plastic or silicon? Not sure if this would work but i'm looking to try anything that might.

Beginners Sewing Tutorials,3,1,"Hi everyone,

Does anyone know of any good beginners tutorials on sewing on youtube? I'm talking about tutorials for absolute beginners. I want to learn about how to set up a sewing machine, the different types of stitches, and stuff like that.

I want to learn how to take in my clothes since my weight yo-yos a lot. I'm starting to lose weight again and want to learn how to do basic things like taking in a shirt or the waist of my pants so I won't have to buy brand new clothes every time I lose or gain weight.

It just has to be as simple as one line of stitching but I don't know anything about how to set up a machine and I can't afford the sewing classes I found in town at the moment.

Thanks!"

Has anyone else experienced this frustration?,6,10,"I've always been an avid art & crafter, and over the last 15ish years I've had COUNTLESS people tell me I should sell my arts and crafts for a living.

However, anytime I post one of my items, people want me to give it to them, but no one wants to buy. I often get asked to make items for wedding, parties, Halloween costumes, home decor, etc... I also get asked to do alterations and repairs a lot, but most of the time no one wants to pay. 

It's absolutely discouraging. I feel like the stuff I make is worthy of being bought, and I have an entire room full of stuff I've thought about selling. I have considered making an Etsy account several times, but I feel like I would be wasting my time since most of the people I've encountered in my life never want to purchase anything.

I create things as a way to convert my stress and anger into something ""productive"" so I've never really made anything solely for the intentions of selling it. I also don't think I'm some amazing artist, but I hate hearing someone tell me I should make a career out of selling my items, but not want to support the statement with a purchase. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just annoyed over nothing, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this same kind of frustration."
How to preserve grandma's memory,1,0,"My grandmother passed away this spring. She had an amazing life and though there was sometimes so much sadness, she was loved by her family. She was not a wealthy woman and she gave away the best parts of her by giving her time and her cooking to three generations of kids, grandkids, and greatgrands. 

The only thing I have from my grandmother are the necklaces she would make out of the fringe, embellishments, and baubles of discarded 80s sweaters. These necklaces exist in elaborate loops and  and braids on aged white stringer. I cannot bear to wear any of these, since I worry I might break the strands while wearing them with the tiny pearl seeds and other delicate tiniest go everywhere. I also am worried about snapping the closing clasped since some part of me gets that it was her hands that tied these and she's now gone.

So my question is, what is the best way to preserve these necklaces my grandmother made? Do I just keep them on display? Retread in white? Use thin wire? TIA"

Whenever I'm drawing/painting/doing detail work, I often subconsciously shift my posture until I'm hunched over my desk completely so I can look more closely at whatever I'm doing.  It's not an eyesight issue, and most info I found online could only recommend ideal desk heights for people working on computers, who can look straight ahead while typing, not people who may have to look down at the desk itself.

When I originally got them, I had hoped the green would ""pop"" in the black light during ""glow bowl"" but it doesn't... not at all...

What I would like to do is paint all the green with some form of bright green pain that will actually react to black light and take the attention away from how bad I am at bowling. lmao

I have browsed the interwebs with Google and found information of all types but little to nothing to cover this particular situation.

Things I do not know and would LOVE some help with if possible...

* What prep should I do to the shoe prior to painting it ? I plan on only painting the green so I assume using some painters tape but I am not sure if I have to do anything special to the shoe leather itself.

* What paint would work on a leather shoe but not flake or peel from use ?  

* Do I need special black light paint or is it just a crap-shoot as to whether it will glow or not ?

* What works best...  spray paint, pens, brushed on ? 

Would love any help possible."

non-adhesive would be preferred.

Can I get some help brainstorming a magnet / craft solution?,1,1,"I'm making a game for my friends and I to play.  Like a group party game personalized for us.  There is a group of like 20 of us leaving the kids at home and headed out for a vacation and it's hard to find something that all of us can participate in together except sitting around drinking alcohol.  


What I want to do is create a game that randomizes each time we play it while also making this very easy to transport.  It's hard to verbalize my vision briefly, so I apologize for this text wall.  


Imagine a 1"" x 6"" magnet (maybe it's needs to be larger so it's easier to read) with a sticker on it that says, ""Play a Round of Heads Up"".  Then that person has to get 12 clues right or they have to take a drink or something.  Another magnet that says, ""Name That Tune"", and the person has to beat the people to their left and right of them to name a song title first.  Losers take a drink.  Or, ""Tell us a truth about you no one knows.""  Now imagine 100 or more of these magnets with things to do on them.  


I want to stick these magnets on to a ""game board"".  My vision is that the board will have 26 spots for magnets.  This way the game is always different.  We will just randomly grab 26 of the magnets and stick them on to the playing board as they are drawn.  Why 26?  Well this way we can use a deck of cards to randomize what people have to do.  So if they pull a red Ace (either the heart or diamond) they do the task on the magnet next to the red ace on the playing board.  


**I'm having a hard time envisioning something that will be the game board** while looking like I put some time into it instead of slapping any old thing together**.**  The Game board will be leaning against the wall or hung on the wall somehow so that everyone can see it from wherever they are standing, sitting, etc.  But the game board needs to be metallic or magnetized somehow so that these magnet pieces can stick to it.  I also need the game board to be easily transported.  I'm taking it on a road trip in the back of my car.  A hard board that might be 2 feet x 4 feet will be hard to keep intact and undamaged for long or many uses.  Something that can roll up would be ideal.  


I've seen some rolled magnet sheets, but would that work?  Would I spray some sort of paint over the top of it so that I could ""write"" on the magnet board?  Or maybe I just make more magnet pieces for the red ace, black queen, etc. and just stick them to the magnet sheet instead of try and make their placement on the board permanent?  I just don't think writing with a marker on the magnetic surface would be visible without putting some sort of top coat on it.  What would that top coat be?  Or do I just print them on adhesive paper and stick on the board?  


Or is this magnet idea dumb and I should go with some other solution I am not thinking of?   


I suppose I could just ditch the board completely and I could just make my own playing cards with the tasks to do on them.  That would eliminate the board completely, but I kind of like the idea of the big board with different stuff.  If I made it a game with just task cards then every game will end up being the same.  Get through the deck and then repeat.  


Or just find a white hard plastic that can be rolled up and use some other sort of attachment solution?  I guess I could use binder clips or something to attach the ""game pieces"" on to the board.  


If you read this far thanks.  If you have some ideas then double thanks!

How to Properly Seal a DIY Phone Case?,2,4,"I recently decided to paint on my phone's old silicon case. I used acrylic paint all over the cover and sides (not the insides). After, it turned out BEAUTIFULLY! The problem is that after I sprayed some Modge Podge clear Acrylic Sealer and letting it dry for a day? It was still tacky. 

I accidentally left it on my blanket and it caused all the fibers to stick to the phone case. I'm gonna repaint it but I'd like some tips so that it won't happen again. I was under the impression that I could use the spray by it self but it also mentioned the liquid acrylic sealer (in the little jar) Maybe that was the problem? Or maybe it was just the brand? This is my first time painting on a phone case btw! 

Thanks!!!"

Fabric Paint and Shoes Question,1,1,"Feel free to direct me to a better sub if this one isnt the right place. 

On Monday, as a craft project I gave my daughter a pair of canvas shoes and some fabric paint and let her go to town. Ive used the paint before and knew it needed 72 hours to dry, but I always err on the side of caution and wait four days before washing and have never had an issue. 

However, the shoes we picked have rubber toes and obviously the sole that she also painted. These areas are still tacky, but I figured if I washed as normal it would wash it off. Now Im left with even tackier paint on these areas. 

My question is, is there a way to dry the fabric paint thats on the rubber? And if not, best suggestions to remove the paint from these areas? They are just cheap white shoes from the hobby store, but she is so excited waiting for them to be ready so Id like to salvage them if possible. 

Thanks for the help!"

Creating a garbage can out of a perfect-sized cardboard box. How can I strengthen it?,2,3,"I have a cardboard box (actually a case of beer) that is the perfect size for a space I have in a pull-out drawer.  I haven't been able to find any garbage cans that fit it and the beer case works perfect - except for the idea that liquids soften the cardboard and eventually bleed through it.

I want to flair the top (so the top is larger than the bottom) and harden it.  What out there might help me harden the cardboard so I don't have to keep recycling it (not to say buying more beer isn't a bad thing).

I don't need to see what the case is but obviously don't want something that is going to permanently smell.  I also don't want to spend a ton of money (like casting it or something).  Would something like Modge Podge or is there a glue or paint that people think might work?  Lacquer seems a tad expensive for this...

Question: DIY Chips dispenser,2,0,"First of I'm not sure if these kind of questions are ok to ask here, if not please direct me to a more suitable subreddit :)

&#x200B;

I'm trying to build a very simple chips/Doritos dispenser. It is not supposed to be very sturdy since it will be more of a gag project but i would like it to be at least somewhat functional. So I'm planning on just building it out of cardboard or some very thin/cheap plywood. I'm still in the drawing phase but i'm already stuck on a problem for which I'd like your input.

&#x200B;

The main problem I'm facing when thinking about it is how to get the chips out of the dispenser without locking the dispenser, crushing the chips or fail to dispense all of the chips.

I had some initial ideas but after some thought they all had a problem that would make the dispenser impractical to use.

&#x200B;

Idea 1: Just make a sort of chute you can pull out from the front making the chips fall straight down

Problem: Closing the chute would break the chips still stuck in between the chute. Also dosing the chips would be difficult since they wouldn't start falling until at least a large portion would fit through the hole.

&#x200B;

Idea 2: Have a sort of rotating horizontal windmill like structure that pushes stacks of chips in between the spokes over a hole, making them fall out.

Problem: rotating the chips over the 'floor' of the structure would likely also break them and (since it will be a low budget contraption) the chips will get stuck in between the spokes and the floor. Moving all the chips at once would put stress on the spokes either bending them. I could solve this by reducing the amount of chips in each section but then it would need some way to refill empty sections. And this is a recursive problem :p

&#x200B;

Idea 3: I experimented with a sort of tilting bucket like system where you could turn a knob from the outside tilting a chips-filled container that drops the chips straight down

Problem: I have had little success with dosing the amount of chips falling out. 

&#x200B;

Idea 4: Have the chips in a hopper feeding a simple conveyor belt that can be turned dropping the chips at the end.

Problem: This sounded complex to build out of cheap materials (read: cardboard) and i'm not sure this would be any better than the first idea with regards to crushing chips when they enter the conveyor belt. Since if i can get them falling onto a conveyor belt I could just use that system to drop them out of the dispenser in the first place.

&#x200B;

I have seen videos where they dispense Pringels (or other roundish chips) by having them sit on rotating tube that makes them fall when rotated. However I think (I haven't tested it yet) that this won't work for non-round shaped chips. Since the center of gravity of  the chips wouldn't necessarily be directly over the tube.

Also if at all possible i'd like the dispenser to be easily refillable. Either by just pouring out a bag inside the dispenser, or have it dispense directly from the bag. This also doesn't seem to work for the ones i saw on YouTube.

&#x200B;

If you have any tips/hints/thoughts on how i could go about doing this that would be greatly appreciated."

Realistic heart in a bottle? Fantasy Potion Shelf Project,1,4,"I'm making a fantasy potion shelf with potions of all kinds of color. Most likely I'll just use water, food coloring and salt. However I'd love for some of them to have a little something extra in there. I've seen a DYI for head in a jar, but that required taking and merging pictures of someone's head. I wonder how can I do something like that with a heart? Can I just find a good picture online and stretch it so it looks good enough under water? I'm definitely thinking a seethrough heart would be best so you can still see through the bottle. That'd also make it a bit more ominous I think.

Wait two days so that the snake can dry.

Now let's color the snake.

Apply some UV glue on the surface after applying color.

This is the red chain snake that has been made.

Fix the snake on the mobile phone shell with UV glue.

Now give them a second UV glue.

In this way, the snake and the mobile phone shell stick more firmly.

This is a finished product.

Of course, this is a model shell

It wasn't that elaborate.

In fact, it will be more elaborate in the process of doing it.

Oh.. ok.. must be mica... but so much!  The bomb isn't a third through yet!  I reached down and ran my hand through the water, and it came out PINK!  As I stood there thinking of this stuff invading my ""personal space"" I decided this should not go further, and dragged it from the bath and pulled the plug.  Relaxation time was over.  I now had to clean the bath...twice!!  It did not come off well or cleanly.  Too much mica and no emulsifier was used at all.

This product had clearly been never tested or this situation would have been discovered. PLEASE... if you are making personal care products test them, and not in a sink, but in actual life situations."

Any ideas on how to restore/upcycle this thrifted bag?,3,3,"I love the style of Longchamp Le Pliage bags, but they were always out of my budget. So I was pretty stoked when I found this [pale yellow one](https://imgur.com/a/6yZ951Y) at a yard sale recently, but the previous owner treated it pretty badly - It has no shape or structure left (she said it's like this because she threw it in the washing machine), and there were a few stains but I was able to get them out. The plastic lining inside is also shredded in a few areas. 

It was only a few dollars so I bought it, thinking that maybe I could restore it somehow. 

Yellow isn't really my colour, so I was wondering if there was a way that I could ""cover"" the outside with another cloth, preferably in a dark colour like black or gray. I was thinking maybe twill or a sturdy-ish cloth. 

 I would still like the leather handles and details to be visible, as well as the zipper. The zipper is yellow, but I figure I can always put in a new one and replace the Longchamp zipperhead charm on it. I also will see if I can replace the lining inside. 

Would you guys have any idea on how I could do this? I'm not trying to make a counterfeit bag at all - I just want to turn this thrifted bag into something that I'll actually use. 

Also is there any way that i could get some structure back into the bag? Maybe by sewing piping on the inside? I'm a beginner at sewing, but I'm pretty crafty in general. 

I'm open to any suggestions! Thanks in advance."

Ideas needed - baby sleep pattern project,1,1,"I've been tracking my daughter's sleep patterns from when she was about ten weeks old. I've got an awesome [Excel chart](http://imgur.com/a/Rn4teAt) now (that's an older version - she's 21 months), but I really want to *make* something out of it. 

(Each column is a day, so there will be around 700 rows by her second birthday - although I could make one ""thing"" per year, so it wasn't so long. Each day is broken into five minute chunks, but I could easily consolidate them into bigger pieces - probably wouldn't want to simplify beyond 15 minute segments though.)

I do lots of cross stitching, so I thought about that, but I'd prefer that it wasn't just something nice in a frame. I've considered scarves, decorative pillowcases, blankets etc, but then I get stuck on how to actually make the thing!

I saw [this amazing blanket](https://twitter.com/Lagomorpho/status/1149754592579600384?s=09) today and that's exactly the kind of thing I've been looking for, but it's knitting :/ 

I've never been able to get the hang of knitting or crochet - I don't seem to have the dexterity required. I love cross stitch because I can easily count the holes, stop-start the project, fix any errors etc.

I thought about weaving / loom knitting, but I'm not sure if I'd be able to switch between colours on one line.

Before I go down the rabbit hole of researching double knitting  , can anyone suggest another craft technique to produce my daughter's sleep chart?

Thanks!"

A beginner seeking advice for a specific project,2,0,"First off, apologies if this kind of post is generally frowned upon here. I didn't see anything that made it sound like it wouldn't be in the rules, but I could just be dumb/blind. But anyway...

So I recently became inspired to recreate a model of this hat that a character I've come to really love and appreciate wears. Here's a couple images of the hat in question:

https://imgur.com/a/w5Nl4fh

To give a very brief summary (in case it helps at all), she's based off of a eurasian tree sparrow that appears in the old japanese fable called the ""Tongue-Cut Sparrow"", and this hat of hers is modeled more directly after what those types of birds look like, but with a more cartoony spin of course.

EDIT: In case it helps to look up more images/angles of the hat, the character's name is ""Benienma"" from the game Fate/Grand Order

While I would love to recreate it as an actual hat, I don't think I'm quite ready to take on that challenge yet, since I probably lack materials I would need such as a sewing machine. However I would love to at least try to recreate it in some form, which is where I need advice. I don't really know what the best way to go about this would be that is realistic to my skill level. I've done paper mache once when I was very young, and a couple projects with the kind of clay you bake afterwards in elementary school. That's about it when it comes to artsy stuff that I feel would apply to this.

So yeah, I guess what I'm asking for is the type of materials, tools, techniques, and any other information you all could think of to guide me on where to go with this project of mine. Again, I apologize if this really isn't the type of thing that's supposed to be here, but regardless I appreciate any and all feedback you have! Thank you so very very much!"

Can you use varnish on musty books?,1,0,"I got the idea a couple years ago to recycle old hardback books into key holders. This involves gluing the pages together and screwing hooks into the front cover.

Originally, I thought I would sell these. However, a large number of the books I ""rescued"" have that old musty smell. And I know some people (myself included) are sensitive to that. And I didn't want to risk allergies, so the project fell to the wayside.

Now, my husband and I are planning to move. We've talked about downsizing our stuff, and he pointed out (fairly) the pile of books I have done nothing with. I'd like to finish the project. I mean, I bought all the materials. Why not?

But I've GOT to do something about the musty smell, and lately I've been thinking maybe use a spray varnish? Ideally, that would coat the cover and seal over the smell? Would that work? Does anyone have any other ideas?

I know there's a TON of advice on how to get rid of musty book smell, like freezing them or using dryer sheets. None of those work. They have never worked. Please don't suggest them. I need some sort of sealant or just throw the whole pile away."

Photo Project - Custom Printing on Tapestry,3,0,"Hi all,

* I am trying to get a **custom print of a photo on tapestry**, but cannot seem to find anyone or anywhere who offers the **fabric** or **size** that I want. Any advice, guidance, or recommendations would be helpful.
* I am looking to get a [black and white photo](https://i.imgur.com/7SqwVfR.jpg) **printed onto** a **thin** fabric tapestry, almost like a [**canga (sarong)**](https://shorturl.at/cEHX6), but not as large.
* The photo is **17.7 x 13.7 inches** (1280 x 988 pixels; 72 dpi), but I would be okay with up to 2 by 3 feet if necessary (the photo is personal, and the one included here is just a very similar looking example). Is this doable?
* I have found websites that offer custom weaving, but my concern is I do not want to lose details in the image, especially since the image resolution is not large, so I prefer it to be printed onto the fabric--as in **ink on fabric**.
* I called around local businesses, and one employee said they could iron a photo on, but I also want the texture of the fabric (like the canga). The same employee recommended trying the site Fiverr, where I have posted a request.

Any thoughts or recommendations would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

I am DIY-ing all the decorations for my wedding and need some help with an idea I have. I am looking to make light posts, similar to the one on the La La Land movie cover. I am stumped on how I can create the bulb at the top. It's not clear, it's a white bulb. I am thinking of making a mold and doing some kind of paper mch? Although I have a ton of questions with that. When the light shines through I will probably see all the seems from the paper mch? Will it burn up if the bulbs are too hot? What kind of paper should I use?

&#x200B;

Does anyone have any recommendations?

&#x200B;

For the base, I am thinking of carving out the post with an EPS foam and just string a wire through the center for the bulb.

I have lots of pencil drawings from when I was younger or in high school that I still love and wish to keep. Id like to even maybe scrap book or make something similar to keep and maybe show my kids some day and just page through when I want to get a blast from the past. 

Any advice on the best way to preserve them? Like how to paste them and good books to use for covers? Its been a long time. 

Or anything I should coat over them to keep them clean or from fading over time? 

In addition to this I keep all my tickets like movies and travel etc. is there something similar that would work to preserve these. Id like to put them into a shadow box some day but they will still fade over time without a little extra help. 

Thank you for your help!"

Polly Pocket Making Advice?,3,8,"I was born in 1999 and grew up on (along with barbies and strawberry shortcake) ""fashion polly"". The Polly Pockets that were three inches with real doll hair and rubber clothes. I loved those, but recently I learned about the old Polly Pockets and how they were compacts for kids to take anywhere! I would have loved that since I personally had lost multiple littlest pet shops and fashion pollies in malls and restaurants. 

So I saw a couple videos of people making there own. I am trying to open an etsy shop and I want to ad homemade Polly Pocket compacts to my items. They used polymer clay and tack glue which I have, but I don't know what the container should be! Pencil and mint tins are too thin for my ideas. So are the nowadays makeup compacts. The best thing I saw around the house was retainer cases, both me and my brother have one but it will be a couple of years before I stop using mine, and many years for my brother's too be available for me to craft with. So what items do you suggest and where would I buy them?

P.S. If I buy a vintage Polly compact, and I heat up a exacto knife's blade and can that cut out all the interior furniture?"

Handmade Christmas Gift for my Girlfriend Advice,1,5,"So I have an idea that I want to do for my girlfriend's Christmas gift this year. I just do not know how to make it. Basically, I have all these little notes she has written to me, they vary in size but are about one inch tall and 6-7 inches long. 

What I want to do is make something out of these notes, something she could use or something she could hang on the wall or display otherwise on her dresser. My initial thought was a jewelry box with these over it with a clear coating of some kind. Or a picture frame with these around a picture of us, again with a clear coating of some kind.

I am just not as creative as I wish I was but thought I could get some suggestions and advice here. I have never used epoxy but thought it might work?"

The official Crown website is barely usable and seems to not have any ""purchase"" options on the site. Any support would be greatly appreciated.

I have a baby boy due this year so I was thinking about trying to do some kind of craft to salvage what I have and put in the nursery since its of no use sitting on a bookshelf anymore.

i am working with maple or ash wood, and have concerns with keeping the metal stamps lined up so the text doesnt look like it is part of a ransom note. and with using ink and a stamping pad, i dont know how well this works on a round surface or if the paint/ink will be durable enough for game use. any thoughts or direction would be awesome. thank you."

How to paint wood like the pages of an old book,1,1,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I want to start this by pointing out that I have very little knowledge of anything artistic and any advice should be kept simple.

&#x200B;

I'm in the middle of turning a wooden box into a box disguised as an old book. I have wrapped the outside in leather, created straps on the top and bottom to keep it closed, and will decorate the interior with a fabric. But I am currently stuck on how to paint the middle section like the edge of pages of a book. My current plan is to use an off white paint with either a red, green, or brow hue, and possibly create lines with a pencil, but I cannot decide what off white to use or if the lines help or not.

&#x200B;

Any help would be appreciated."

"If You Had To Get Graphics & Text Onto A Tortilla, How Would You Do It?",3,6,"Background: A boss is retiring after 40 years, and I want to give him a fun ""gag"" gift. He is known for his daily email where he signs off with some random personal piece of wisdom (think Jack Handey in 100 characters), his love of tortillas, and having a great sense of humor. My hope is to find a way to giving him a bag of about 100 tortillas all including a different one of his pieces of wisdom printed on one side, and on the other side, any one of a bunch of digital pictures we have of him in our archive. These won't be edible.

My only real ""requirement"" is that the text isn't hand written (in addition to me having really poor handwriting, I've also found that using something like, say, a sharpie marker tends to tear the tortilla).

So far the ideas I've come up with are as follows:

Some sort of digital printing, like a direct to cake printer.
Adhering the photo/text by having it printed on some sort of ""Sticky"" paper. (i don't want to have to cut around all the letters by hand, though).
Printing the text/photo on transfer paper and attempting to hot press them onto the tortilla.
Rubber Stamping the text.
Printing out stencils for each quote and using roll-on ink to create the text.

Would really love to hear your thoughts, as I'm generally not a very crafty person.

Thanks in advance!"

I'm struggling to figure out which paint I should use that doesn't sink into the fabric. I find that the bubble paint gets messy and doesn't have the finish I want. Any help would be much appreciated!

I know some of what's used , like the dustbuster for the head, a ping pong ball, the red hands, I just need to know what the body is, it's mentioned in this vid that it's a paint bucket body: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEFhM1v0KA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULEFhM1v0KA)

Just need to know if such a thing still exists, also for the mouth it uses some kind of hinges to keep it close but also pull down easily, was wondering if there's anything similar."

I'd like to add decoupage to some areas with napkins but I don't have any decoupage medium and the project needs to be finished soon.

So, can I use the varnish to decoupage them on? It's able to be watered down so thickness is not a problem."

I've googled some stuff and I can only find sites that let you make one rectangle magnet and get a whole bunch of them rather than one broccoli, one carrot, one cheese, etc shaped magnets.

If anyone could help me with this I'd really appreciate it! Thanks~"
