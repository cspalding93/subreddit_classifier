attention crafty crafters who know a thing or two about fabrics/paints/measurements hi everyone !  i want to make my son a halloween costume which is based off of a character he loves basically i need to make an entire ball which covers his whole body (maybe besides his head/arms) i plan to stuff it with something any idea how much fabric i would need if he is 5 and i want the ball to be globe-shaped around his body ?  (maybe 3 ft wide all around) thanks for any input not even sure if im asking in the proper place also i have not sewed something since 7th grade so also do glow in the dark fabrics exist ?  ideally his costume will glow unsure if to get a glow in the dark fabric paint to paint the entire thing or actual fabric which responds to lack of light source thank you for reading ! ,1

a [quite possibly] strange request hello !  someone on r/reddeadredemption pointed me in this direction to look for answers and/or help so heres the story; a couple weeks ago my mum started talking about my cat needing a hat normally this sort of thing trails off but it hasnt this time i know shes been super stressed with a lot of not nice things going on in our lives so i thought that maybe this would give her a little respite of happiness so i decided to endeavour to get my cat a hat that being said i am incredibly shallow and selfish and decided that if i was going to sink any money into a hat for a cat that hates literally everything that i would seek out a hat that would also give me a little bit of happiness that hat just so happens to be arthur morgans hat from red dead redemption 2 so the strange request im bringing forth is this: does anyone know of anyone or any place that might be able to indulge me in this ?  maybe an etsy store that doesnt show up in my cursory search or someone on instagram that i wouldnt think of or even someone here that might be interested in the endeavour ?  i would truly appreciate any help you might have to offer xx,1

need advice for pendant sealing hello everyone im new to this subreddit but i figured this would be a good place to ask - ive been working on making pendants out of rocks i find at my local rivers and painting on them and ive been looking for a good way to seal them so that they have a glossy finish and will be less likely to break if dropped at first i covered it with epoxy resin which smooths itself out and has an even finish while adding a layer of protection but that is difficult to apply tends to have noticeable bubbles and doesnt dry entirely clear (has a yellow-ish tint) i then tried a krylon clear spray-on paint thing and that also gave a nice gloss and even finish but doesnt dry very well and gets scratches in it extremely easy so i then tried a clear enamel acrylic paint but you need a paintbrush to apply it which means you can see the paintbrush strokes so its not smooth at all and also tends to get scratched (despite the internets claims that it was scratch resistant :/) so i wanted to know if anyone had advice for some other substance i could use or if theres a different way i could use any of the methods i listed above ?  thank you so much ! ,1

(it doesnt have to be the original pieces of paper since some are big with few words on it taking up more space) he also wrote me a poem a while ago and i want to frame that too so maybe two frames in a letter format is too much plainness ?  im having trouble figuring out how to display and frame them since im not a creative person and i thought someone from this subreddit could help me sorry if this type of thing doesnt belong here (im new) ! ,1

advice on schoolwide outdoor fabric bunting project (teachers please help too !  ! ) i am on my daughters school pta and as part of our summer fair and event decoration we have strings of fabric bunting which is strung up outside last summer fair i noticed that the bunting was falling apart and as some of it is 13 years old i volunteered to organise a schoolwide project to create new bunting here are the finer details : 1) we are in the uk and the school is underfunded so all supplies have to be paid for out of the pta savings 2) the children are aged 2 - 7 (nursery to year 2) 3) there are 4 year groups (nursery (4 classes) reception y1 & y2) and aside from nursery each year group has 3 separate classes with roughly 30 students per class 4) the plan was to make 2-3 big banners plus enough bunting to go around the perimeter of the school (i still need to measure that) and so it would be preferable for each of the year groups (aside from nursery) to create a banner and each child (including nursery) will decorate a triangle 5) i offered to sew the bunting to the string if need be but i plan to get precut triangles and string/bias tape ?  ?  i dont mind ironing each triangle to set any fabric decor 6) we are in england and it rains a lot the bunting has to withstand rain and wind but will only be used a few weeks per year but i want this bunting to last it would also be helpful if it doesnt take too long to dry after rainfall heres what i need help with : 1) whats the best fabric to use for this ?  was thinking burlap/hessian but worried it would be hard to decorate i am not prepared to hem each triangle 2) what is the best medium to apply to the triangles that would be weather proof ?  im thinking markers paint fabric glue ?  ?  ?  i originally thought to steer away from sticking bits on as the old bunting is shedding sequins and felt all over the place 3) i was hoping to colour code the string somehow so we can easily tell which length of bunting fits on each section of fence but should each class have a different colour scheme or theme ?  i want the bunting to look nice and coordinated (and kid created) 4) whats a reasonable amount of decorating medium (paint /markers) per class ?  i can get sets of paint but i dont know how many each class would need also was thinking sets with mainly primary colours are cheaper but that will be glaring bunting whats the likelihood kids will mix to make another range of colours ?  5) am i over thinking this ?  is there an easier way ? ,1

have you ever used claycrete or celluclay ?  hello !  i did a search on this but surprisingly got no hits !  i facilitate the art club at my school and were starting a project in which the students make paper mache cake slices theyve made the general shape of the slice with cardboard and will now cover it with paper mache someone suggested using [claycrete](https://wwwdickblickcom/products/amaco-claycrete-instant-papier-m-and-226che/) but it seems expensive have you used this product before ?  it looks great but i cant figure out how much to buy so that each student has enough of it to cover their cake slice bonus: if you have any ideas for a cheaper alternative i would be so grateful !  im aware of paper strips and flour/water but would like to avoid it because it takes forever to actually do it however if claycrete is cost prohibitive we will probably use this method,1

type of yarn/tips for crocheting safe cat toys ?  hello !  first of all first post on reddit at least on this account (i dont have almost any access to the email for the old one) secondlyive started to learn to crochet and im thinking of making some nice cat toys for my three cats ive noticed one of them loves playing with and chewing on string i dont know if i can give him that perfectly though im trying to get him some rope-based toys (we got him one recently and i immediately accidentally broke it) but i could at least crochet like- thin little tube things with texture or toys to attach to a cord plus a few cute little animal-shaped ones or whatever which at least he and the babiest cat both like playing with (i think queen lady-of-the-house cat just does most of her playing when we arent looking) **the question is:** are cat toys made from natural yarns (probably cotton or hemp or bamboo my mom is allergic to wool so im not just going to leave wool cat toys around the house for her) ever safe ?  im thinking about how they can be bitten apart and swallowed or come undone- the good news is im good at making nice tight stiff stitches are yarns with any % synthetic content safe/in any way sub-optimal for them ?  are any actually better ?  do you know of any dyes i should look out for and/or any brands that avoid dyes that might be harmful ?  im gonna try to support my local knitting shop so i want to try to buy within their stock and havent checked it out yet but also want to know if there are any known health hazards or other rules/tips learned about making cat toys actually come to think of it what about safe stuffing ?  i might experiment with crinkly paper and might make a few unstuffed tubes but little conventionally stuffed amigurumi toys would be neat too please know you dont gotta answer all of these questions to reply im just putting all of my thoughts out there and any nugget of insight is appreciated,1

question about affixing pressed flowers to a glass frame hi !  its my first time here so i hope this is alright to post im in the process of setting some flowers that i pressed in a clear double sided frame like [this](https://ipinimgcom/originals/50/65/76/5065766ede930d89c714cf91e25356c2jpg) these flowers were pressed from a special occasion so i cant afford to mess it up !  i put them in place and closed the frame but unfortunately theres too much space between the two panes of glass so they arent pinned in place and slide about im thinking i have to glue the flowers to the frame but i dont know what kind of glue is best to use i know it needs to dry clear but all i can find is glue for glass and glue for organic materials and this needs to work for both !  ideally it would dry so it could be viewed from both sides but if it ends up needing to be one-sided for practical reasons then thats fine is regular superglue alright ?  the final piece would hopefully look something like [this](https://ipinimgcom/originals/60/af/ba/60afbaf446a179e0ab939879a4491b63jpg) for reference any help and advice would be greatly appreciated ! ,1

is it possible to sand and polish cured hot glue to a shine ?  say i want to fill in a open gap on an object with hot glue when its fully cooled and cured is it possible to sand the glue to the shape/flatness i need and then polish it ?  aiming for the result of appearing relatively clear/transparent and a smooth plastic like shine and reflectivity i have a feeling the glue would just quickly load up the sand paper and eventually not produce the desired finish any advice on how to get this result or other ideas for similar results ?  hot glue is the easiest method that i already have on hand to work with just never attempted to sand and polish it,1

putting a velcro back on hand stitched patch hi all !  so im doing crossfit and i have a military style back back i wanted a company to embroider a patch for me but all company i found has a 10 pieces minimum so i looked online how to hand embroider (sorry if its not the right word english in my second language) a patch it looks like a fun project !  i have seen satin stitch used a lot which looks fine by me for the design i will be doing any tips and tricks to make the embroider looks professional and not too much hand stitch  ?  like to have clean and equal line  ?  !  i guess to take my time and make sur the line are as straight as i can ?  !  my question: what would be the easier way of having a velcro (hooknloop) back on the patch ?  i do not own a sewing machine also: i know its hard for you to tell but i long should i be allowing for hand stitch a patch ?  i know it depends on the design but id like a way to give me an idea !  thanks all !  - from a future first timer ! ,1

going to a craft fair for the first time at a local farm do i need to obtain a sellers permit from the state first ?  previously ive been selling signs locally on facebook marketplace and theyve done very well i make the product end to end short of chopping down trees myself i have some designs that sell well on marketplace with a high conversion rate i think they would do well at a craft fair so i found one a few minutes from my house in about 8 days that will allow me to sell there i dont have a sellers permit from the state it would take 3 weeks to get approved my question is this based on research ive done i know that i can legally sell privately and occasionally from my property as a hobby without remitting sales tax (no different than a garage sale) a craft fair is somewhat scaled up from there and i think would be in commercial sellers territory (if i sold off all the product i have on hand which i doubt will happen id have around $3k in sales) i do have an llc already from a previous company that i can sell under but i dont have a sellers permit because that company sold digital non physical goods have any of you sold at a craft fair and have you gone through the correct legal channels to obtain a sellers permit in your state ? ,1

need inspiration so i have lost confidence in a lot of things in my life recently i bought a long canvas to make something for my mother last christmas but - due to said loss of confidence - i didnt end up making anything with it i still really want to use it somehow but this time to make something for myself does anyone have any suggestions on something fairly easy that looks nice ?  i love the acrylic paintings where they use spatulas so theres texture but i have never even touched a spatula and i really dont have experience with painting on canvas besides the typical wine and canvas parties i dont want to do something completely abstract because i dont necessarily enjoy that type of art - i want to be able to recognize something in it also i love the ocean and sailboats if anyone has experience with these types of projects or you have any pictures that you think would help inspire i would truly appreciate it just googling things isnt getting me anywhere [example of dimensions](https://wwwmichaelscom/artists-loft-back-stapled-canvas/10230614html ? cm_mmc=plasearch-_-google-_-mich_shopping_us_n_artsupplies-privatelabel_n_n_n_n_gos-_-art+supplies&gclid=cj0kcqjw2efrbrd3arisaent0eiwhmcsv0jgewb7dhxu6pfov1sl1k7a8hlczkinipeu80arqvvdivqaanwlealw_wcb),1

has anyone else noticed that big craft stores are focusing more on home decor and less on actual craft supplies ?  ive been noticing this trend over the past few years i feel like big craft giants like michaels and ac moore are using up more and more of their space for home decor and ready-made decorations and less space for yknow actual craft supplies i just stopped by (or should i say took the time to drive 20 minutes to) michaels for some plastic needlepoint canvas and unfinished wooden dowels and they didnt have either in the store i feel like these are such basic craft supplies that i know theyve had for years and which ive purchased from them before how do you not have wooden sticksat a craft store ?  !  this has been happening to me more and more frequently has anyone else noticed this trend ?  i feel like its pushing me to shop online from places like amazon which id rather not support (because of their wasteful packaging and their poor ethics) but its kind of the only option to get everything i need quickly and in one go,1

help with instructions for kids craft involving altering images with glue when i was a kid at camp we did a craft one year where we applied glue to images (nature postcards) and when the glue dried it made it look as though the image was a painting of some kind i tried to reproduce it recently and i seem to have forgotten a step because it just ended up looking like the original image but slightly glossier i remember it had a lot more texture when i did it as a kid does anyone know what this technique is or if theres more to it ?  i used liquid glue from the dollar store it was a fairly sketchy camp so i cant imagine they were using much of their budget on craft supplies &#x200b; any help would be greatly appreciated,1

[https://simpleformcomau/products/floating-leaves-transparent-print-06](https://simpleformcomau/products/floating-leaves-transparent-print-06) my first thought was a straight sandwich of a leaf between two pieces of glass/plexi but even with a firmly pressed leaf it would be problem with air getting in and not being perfectly flush that could cause issues my next idea has been using self-levelling resin poured over a leaf on plexi to seal it and make it flush and then placing another piece of glass or plexi on top havent tried it yet but before i do does anyone have any better ideas ?  id like to be able to do some flowers and things to mount them like that,1

advice on what paint/primer/sealer works best on a wood composite box [this was my first beginner here so please forgive me of my lack of knowledge on available products last week i made this for my brothers wedding and used the following: -artminds primer -decoart americana decor matte metallics (in the 8 oz canister) -royal &amp; langnickel 25 piece brush set that were approved for acrylics long story short the primer seemed ok however the paint was the bane of my existence no exaggeration i was painting layers from 1 pm-3am and as you can see in the image theres still streaks unevenness etc i dont know where i went wrong was it the primer ?  is there a better type of paint to use on wood composite than acrylic ?  was it the brushes ?  unfortunately i didnt have time to seal this but i did use sealing spray on plastic frames before and seemed to do the trick but im trying to find one best for this type of craft/best even coverage potentially not a spray ?  im making a second one for a friend and want to majorly improve it will be a matte navy blue tips on brands or specific products ?  !  ninja edit: i did sand prior to priming with very fine sanding paper ! ,1

how to turn handwritten notes into art ?  hello !  i am a creative but only when it comes to music i often have very creative vision for things outside of music but cant execute due to lack of skill/effort haha i am hoping someone here can help me out i have several handwritten notes that have words of encouragement on them that mean a lot to me theres probably 20 to 30 different paragraphs that ive received from people over the years and i would like to turn them into a art piece it is very important to me that i use the original handwriting from each person i dont want to simply turn the words into digital text however i would like to print some type of photo that has them all combined and im not sure where to start or how to put them all together the notes are written on different cards with different backgrounds so when i cut out each note digitally after taking a photo of it they tend to crash a lot are there any tools or ways that i could get just the text and its original form extracted from the background so that i could take all the words and put them on one big page or photo to print ?  if there was a better place to post this please let me know,1

does it ever get old when people ask you to make things for them ?  i mainly crochet and cross stitch ive gotten pretty good and i have a lot of wearable stuff and things all over my home that ive made and dont get me wrong i love doing it !  but i feel like when friends and family ask me to make something for them they dont take into consideration how long its going to take and all of the work that goes into it usually i just ask that whoever wants something pays for the materials and then guess what ?  nobody wants to spend $100 on that queen size cabled blanket but they didnt mind asking me to do it as a favor for them for free 99% of the time i just chalk it up to they didnt realize how much it would cost which is fair because yarn for bigger projects can be expensive it also can be difficult finding a pattern for someone normally its just i want x can you make it so then i have to either hunt for or make the pattern for whatever they want and then making the pattern is a whole other headache so far i have 7 requests for laptop cases after i brought mine with me a few places mine is a simple c2c and that didnt take long at all but im just not looking forward to doing a bunch of multiple color laptop cases because thats all anyone wants my aunt wants me to make little christmas stocking for her entire third grade class this year a friend wants me to cross stitch a pokmon for them but only with a super detailed picture that took two hours to fix up and will end up being like 25x28 inchs when im done so i want to know if its just me or does crafting on command get a little old for everyone else ? ,1

looking for a crafting/macguyver kind of solution not sure if this would be sub to post this in but my parents had ordered the incorrect rolls of credit card paper for our machine the rolls width is fine but its the amount thats the problem they fit if theyre whittled down to half their size by hand-spooling to a previously used black plastic credit card roll i was thinking if we had something like what they use for silk like having two rolls on sticks to hold them up and using a hand crank to spin it until they both reach half of the total while also keeping it aligned so there only needs to be minimal adjustment to straighten it out sounds like its a lot of work for something so seemingly trivial but we have an entire box worth of credit card rolls and we just ran out of the last one that was fixed by hand id appreciate any thoughts on how to go about doing this the only way that pops up in mind is having the three components (crank and two rolls on fitted sticks) be linked together by gears somehow i was initially thinking of it would be made of wood but if its possible to just buy metal parts that could be put together to make something thatll function id be all for that &#x200b; thank you in advance for any help ! ,1

hvac mastic ?  hello all has anyone ever used hvac mastic sealant for any type of craft work ?  i do a lot of builds for my wifes school building displays for book fairs etc my latest is a large igloo made from cardboard and mastic seems like an easy way to beef up the interior walls and possibly the outer wall seems like mastic would also work well for tree trunks or other rough texture surfaces while adding durability the mastic is water based and doesnt seem to be overly toxic while dried especially considering its usually used for ac ducts that push air around buildings,1

mint works pnp for those wanting to spend their time printing cutting glueing bending and stuff like that pnp [https://drivegooglecom/open ? id=1fwejl0tx6pcikp844xk62ih7g5shwcf-](https://drivegooglecom/open ? id=1fwejl0tx6pcikp844xk62ih7g5shwcf-) enjoy !  i printed the box on a cereal box if you do make sure to print the box outer to something like 108% and the inner to like 106% to account for the thickness of your cereal cardboard fair warning: building pnp mw took me about 3 evenings so that is about 12 hours by buying the product instead you save yourself an hourly wage of $250 per hour on the plus side pnp are indestructible and you can take your pnp on holidays or hotel nights for business travel if you really like it and intend to play it more you can always buy the 2nd edition from the creators,1

need advice on how much cloth to get im not sure if you guys answer questions like this one so if you dont just let me know and ill delete it im planing on making halloween costumes for my dogs this year i know what i want them to be but unfortunately i cant find anywhere that sells the costumes and the one place i did find is on etsy but sadly a bit too out of my price range i had made a costume for one of them previously for a walk/run/costume contest so im not worried about figuring out how to make it my issue is trying to figure out how much cloth ill need to buy for them it was easier before when i was only making a costume for one (i actually have some extra left over that im trying to figure out what to do with) but im not sure how much more i need to get for them both the one i didnt make one for previously is a bit smaller but not much more than the other so should i double the amount of cloth or does it depend on what type of cloth i use ?  i had used nylon before but im thinking of using something thicker that can still stretch to allow movement since i only used nylon because it was summer and i didnt want him overheating im open to any ideas or help that anyone is willing to give ! ,1

need help with some deep resin casting trying to avoid buying $150 worth of resin to get the right depth so im doing a 3d painting which involves pouring resin and painting on each layer so it ends up with a 3d effect my canvas is a 12x12x2 box in order to get the depth id want i need to have a bit of resin built up first it would take 32oz just to reach a decent depth and buying 32oz of resin just to get the base done seems wasteful is there any material i can use to take up space while remaining invisible in the resin ?  i tried some thick plexiglass but the edges are still visible maybe if i cut it to an exact size it may work but anyone have any better ideas ? ,1

any good cheap button makers on amazon ?  so im in a slight pickle - i am selling at long beach comic-con this weekend and designed a bunch of buttons that i would make on-site i ordered a tecre kit online from the company and was supposed to have it shipped to my location unfortunately due to an error on my part its not going to arrive in time for the convention amazon can get me a button maker by tomorrow but mophorn machines are pretty pricey for what i hear are pretty bad machines im aiming for $50 and under which i know is a huge ask it can be a childs button maker for all i care - my one criteria is that it needs to be able to survive a two-day convention i have other things to sell so it wouldnt be the end of the world but id definitely like to use these button designs thanks in advance for any suggestions ! ,1

help with tie-dye or dip dye hello lovely people i have a question for you my husband and i got married 3 years ago i bought an absolutely gorgeous vera wang dress and i love it i love it so much that it makes me sad to see it having no further use and just taking up closer space we are big fans of the renaissance festival near our home and go multiple times every year so i had the idea to tie-dye or dip dye my dress and turn it into a fairy costume the material is satin with a tulle overlay i was thinking about leaving the tulle white and placing led lights between the color layer and the tulle layer so my question is what is the best way to dye the satin ?  ive watched a few videos and done some googling but cant seem to find a consensus on the best way to do so and of course i dont want to experiment on my dress so ill be making trial runs before i make that step thoughts ?  tips ?  tricks ?  please help me thanks in advance ! ,1

uv resin vs hot glue for adhesive i was getting ready to start using my new uv resin to bond glass and metal for jewelry (and cork and glass) when i saw a video stating that uv isnt *actually* meant for adhesive purposes just filling/doming/casting ironically you can often see uv resin advertised as glue because of its quick cure time via uv light is there any truth to this or does it just depend on the materials youre trying to cure together ?  i want to get a second opinion before i experiment with liquid filled glass and end up with a huge mess,1

can i sandwich resin between two solid layers ?  hi r/crafts im completely new to using resin and ive been looking at tutorials and tips on working with it ive had an idea for a project utilising resin between what is essentially two slabs of wood (30cm long 11cm wide 1cm deep) so the end goal is a solid layer a clear resin layer and another solid wood layer in the end id like it to be one 3cm deep block what im after is guidance on whether its possible to sandwich a layer of resin between two wood slabs like this and if i can put the wood layer on top and ideally have it all stick together without the need to join it with screws etc having done some searching about layering all im really finding is tips on multiple layers of resin on top of one another but thats not really what im after if someone can point me in the right direction it would be much appreciated ! ,1

uv resin troubles ?  im very new to crafting and even newer to using uv resin which i decided to try after the cure time of regular art resin became a bit too stressful to work under i like a resin that allows me to perfect little details in the design as long as i care to before curing at the moment im attempting to dome some basic circle pendants just metal backings with a printed image inside the trouble im having is that when i hold my uv light over it the resin warps and lifts up away from the backing plate i end up with basically a hard resin bowl sitting in the center of my backing plate the resin also smokes/steams quite a bit when curing ive considered that maybe the uv flashlight i got for this purpose is too strong ?  could it be causing warping by curing too quickly ?  has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution ? ,1

advice wanted -- leaving a negative review okay guys i need some advice for once im on the buyer side not the crafter side im about to leave my first negative review ever on an etsy purchase i want to make sure im being fair i purchased a \~$120 branding package which at the time included a pdf/png/psd/ai files of a custom-made main logo two sublogos some fonts and a color scheme/palette i am paraphrasing as after i purchased it and had paid she altered the description of the branding package to no longer include ai files fonts or colors i wish i had screenshotted it after i purchased but i didnt realize that shop owners could alter descriptions after the fact the artwork she made for my logo was lovely and absolutely met the specifications i gave so thats why im not going to leave a 1-star review however when it came time to deliver my final products the psd for the main logo the fonts and the color palette were all missing (the ais were missing too but i didnt really need/care about those so whatever) when i pointed out that psds fonts and a color scheme had been included when i paid she apologized and sent the missing psd but still no fonts or color palette in addition because i was missing the fonts i couldnt use the psds when i indicated again that i hadnt received what i had paid for i was given the name of a single font that will cost me an additional $15-$20 and a hexcode for a single color instead of a palette of colors that would work well together right now im angry im debating between giving her two stars or three stars i feel more like two stars but i want to be fair and i know that im not always fair when im angry,1

(things like glass bowls and the like) my friends registry was on zola and they do not do gift boxes or wrapping so everything arrived in a brown shipping box i have been searching the internet for gift boxes that would support the weight of her registry items however all the ones i think might work just end up bottoming out because the boxes are too thin and flimsy has anyone had this issue before ?  can anyone recommend gift boxes not made out of flimsy paper products ? ,1

how to remove marvy permanent fabric marker (aka the story of a very unfortunate sweatshirt) is there any way to remove this marker from fabric as its intended to be permanent ?  should i try paint thinner bleach hydrogen peroxide or what ?  this is yet another misstep in a hilariously tragic journey of trying to fix an accidental bleach stain on a sweatshirt i have tried both coloring the bleached spot darker so it wouldnt be noticeable and removing color from around the spot with the same intention now for the second time im trying to re-dye it and now ive gotten most of the dye i used last time as well as the original color out of the garment and all that remains is that damned fabric marker on the spots that used to be bleached and are now darker than the rest im afraid that if i try to dye it all over now those spots will still remain darker so im trying to remove the permanent marker and hoping that i could get the spot reach the same tone as the rest of the fabric so i could dye it again because its color was what i liked about it the most from the start so thats what im desperately trying to get back im a little concerned what will be left of the shirt after all these bleaches hot washes etc i already fixes one hole that probably came in the washing machine soon ive probably also splurged the price of a similar new garment to all these dyes and bleaches i hope to get some encouraging advice how to continue as theres no turning back now and i also hope someone could learn from my mistakes,1

new to candle making as a hobby looking for advice and discussion with fellow candle makers hello fellow candle makers my wife daughter and i have recently started making candles as a hobby and working on perfecting them now we started about 6 months ago but quickly got discouraged with the amount of different combos(wicks wax jars pour temp etc) trial/error period and how time consuming it would be to perfect everything all while working raising 4 kids etc we want to start back working on candles because we really enjoy working on them and the process we have decided to just be patient and not rush things now we are using gb 444 soy wax adding the fragrance oil(from aztec) at 175 degrees and pouring at 130-135 degrees weve done a few at 8% 10% and 12% we have used standard 4oz mason jars and 8oz patio jars we have been using premier wicks wi-767 6 1/2 inches wicks for both jars it was the recommended wick on our initial purchase from aztec to use with the 8oz jars the wicks didnt seem to be strong enough for the 8oz jars but seem perfect for the little 4oz jars we have only made about 20 candles in total we have let them cure for 24hrs 48hrs 72hrs 1 week and 2 weeks the cold throw is great but no matter how long the cure time is or how much fo is added the hot throw isnt very strong at all is there another wax like paraffin we can mix with the 444 to help with the scent throw or should we use a different blend all together ?  we have 50 lbs of the 444 soy wax we will be purchasing more fragrance oils jars and wicks within the next week or so because we have ran out of all 3 any recommendations there ?  also we are looking for any advice personal experiences tips tricks combos cure times recommended fragrance oils or fragrance oil companies different jars adding color or anything else that will help us perfect our candlemaking please feel free to comment i would love to hear from some experienced candle makers and learn a lot i plan to be very active in this sub-reddit and i will post our progress along the way thank you all so much in advance pics from most recent candles we made,1

"putty style stuff that sticks to styrofoam - what to use !  ?  hi reddit !  im making a video for the video i need to have a face moulded onto a styrofoam head like a layer of skin the head is one of those standard styrofoam wig/sunglasses modelling heads its made from this because behind the face a whole lot of shapes/things have been cut into it/added to it that suited the material the thing is i need to mold a face onto it as part of the video like someone carving a clay face but massaging it into the already present contours of the head problem is im struggling to find something that actually will stick/stay on the styrofoam so far ive tried a conventional ""play doh"" and plasticine any other ideas ?  it might be easier to know that the shoot will use two heads - one will have the face already pre constructed (so if it hardens/sticks to it thats fine) before the filming takes place - the final head the shoot will show the construction of the ""final head"" but using a different one (identical styrofoam head) and molding the stuff to it so it doesnt have to be sturdy/a material that will be molded to it and stay perfectly its transitional to the final cut it also doesnt matter if it looks a bit shit (thats the idea) keep in mind this is a low low budget skeleton crew production was considering looking into getting something made with latext etc but its just not going to fit into the project",1

advice needed: giant engagement ring ?  hello !  &#x200b; at my wedding next summer we want our ringbearer to carry a giant engagement ring down the aisle ive seen some cute inflatable ones but im not 100% sold on the idea of an inflatable i feel like i could do it better/classier/more impressively ive seen some giant ones - as in theyre made for people to float in - but hes only three years old and it might be difficult for him to carry one that large &#x200b; so really ultimately i am hoping to craft something i keep going back to the thought of a wreath ring/form for the ring part painted gold but i dont get further than that when i brainstorm how would you guys go about making a large engagement ring that is holdable for small hands ?  it might be cute to have one engagement ring and one regular band (entwined ?  ?  ?  but how to do that ?  ?  ? ) but id be happy with just the engagement ring one if it came down to it its just for the aisle walk/pictures to be cute/unique/funny &#x200b; thanks ! ,1

"has anyone else experienced this frustration ?  ive always been an avid art & crafter and over the last 15ish years ive had countless people tell me i should sell my arts and crafts for a living however anytime i post one of my items people want me to give it to them but no one wants to buy i often get asked to make items for wedding parties halloween costumes home decor etc i also get asked to do alterations and repairs a lot but most of the time no one wants to pay its absolutely discouraging i feel like the stuff i make is worthy of being bought and i have an entire room full of stuff ive thought about selling i have considered making an etsy account several times but i feel like i would be wasting my time since most of the people ive encountered in my life never want to purchase anything i create things as a way to convert my stress and anger into something ""productive"" so ive never really made anything solely for the intentions of selling it i also dont think im some amazing artist but i hate hearing someone tell me i should make a career out of selling my items but not want to support the statement with a purchase i dont know maybe im just annoyed over nothing but i was wondering if anyone else has experienced this same kind of frustration",1
how to preserve grandmas memory my grandmother passed away this spring she had an amazing life and though there was sometimes so much sadness she was loved by her family she was not a wealthy woman and she gave away the best parts of her by giving her time and her cooking to three generations of kids grandkids and greatgrands the only thing i have from my grandmother are the necklaces she would make out of the fringe embellishments and baubles of discarded 80s sweaters these necklaces exist in elaborate loops and and braids on aged white stringer i cannot bear to wear any of these since i worry i might break the strands while wearing them with the tiny pearl seeds and other delicate tiniest go everywhere i also am worried about snapping the closing clasped since some part of me gets that it was her hands that tied these and shes now gone so my question is what is the best way to preserve these necklaces my grandmother made ?  do i just keep them on display ?  retread in white ?  use thin wire ?  tia,1

"painting leather bowling shoes to begin is a picture of the shoe(s) i plan on painting glossy black and lime green leather bowling shoes when i originally got them i had hoped the green would ""pop"" in the black light during ""glow bowl"" but it doesnt not at all what i would like to do is paint all the green with some form of bright green pain that will actually react to black light and take the attention away from how bad i am at bowling lmao i have browsed the interwebs with google and found information of all types but little to nothing to cover this particular situation things i do not know and would love some help with if possible * what prep should i do to the shoe prior to painting it  ?  i plan on only painting the green so i assume using some painters tape but i am not sure if i have to do anything special to the shoe leather itself * what paint would work on a leather shoe but not flake or peel from use  ?  * do i need special black light paint or is it just a crap-shoot as to whether it will glow or not  ?  * what works best spray paint pens brushed on  ?  would love any help possible",1

"can i get some help brainstorming a magnet / craft solution ?  im making a game for my friends and i to play like a group party game personalized for us there is a group of like 20 of us leaving the kids at home and headed out for a vacation and its hard to find something that all of us can participate in together except sitting around drinking alcohol what i want to do is create a game that randomizes each time we play it while also making this very easy to transport its hard to verbalize my vision briefly so i apologize for this text wall imagine a 1"" x 6"" magnet (maybe its needs to be larger so its easier to read) with a sticker on it that says ""play a round of heads up"" then that person has to get 12 clues right or they have to take a drink or something another magnet that says ""name that tune"" and the person has to beat the people to their left and right of them to name a song title first losers take a drink or ""tell us a truth about you no one knows"" now imagine 100 or more of these magnets with things to do on them i want to stick these magnets on to a ""game board"" my vision is that the board will have 26 spots for magnets this way the game is always different we will just randomly grab 26 of the magnets and stick them on to the playing board as they are drawn why 26 ?  well this way we can use a deck of cards to randomize what people have to do so if they pull a red ace (either the heart or diamond) they do the task on the magnet next to the red ace on the playing board **im having a hard time envisioning something that will be the game board** while looking like i put some time into it instead of slapping any old thing together**** the game board will be leaning against the wall or hung on the wall somehow so that everyone can see it from wherever they are standing sitting etc but the game board needs to be metallic or magnetized somehow so that these magnet pieces can stick to it i also need the game board to be easily transported im taking it on a road trip in the back of my car a hard board that might be 2 feet x 4 feet will be hard to keep intact and undamaged for long or many uses something that can roll up would be ideal ive seen some rolled magnet sheets but would that work ?  would i spray some sort of paint over the top of it so that i could ""write"" on the magnet board ?  or maybe i just make more magnet pieces for the red ace black queen etc and just stick them to the magnet sheet instead of try and make their placement on the board permanent ?  i just dont think writing with a marker on the magnetic surface would be visible without putting some sort of top coat on it what would that top coat be ?  or do i just print them on adhesive paper and stick on the board ?  or is this magnet idea dumb and i should go with some other solution i am not thinking of ?  i suppose i could just ditch the board completely and i could just make my own playing cards with the tasks to do on them that would eliminate the board completely but i kind of like the idea of the big board with different stuff if i made it a game with just task cards then every game will end up being the same get through the deck and then repeat or just find a white hard plastic that can be rolled up and use some other sort of attachment solution ?  i guess i could use binder clips or something to attach the ""game pieces"" on to the board if you read this far thanks if you have some ideas then double thanks !  &#x200b; https://ireddit/ll78bj1m1qc31jpg",1

how to properly seal a diy phone case ?  i recently decided to paint on my phones old silicon case i used acrylic paint all over the cover and sides (not the insides) after it turned out beautifully !  the problem is that after i sprayed some modge podge clear acrylic sealer and letting it dry for a day ?  it was still tacky i accidentally left it on my blanket and it caused all the fibers to stick to the phone case im gonna repaint it but id like some tips so that it wont happen again i was under the impression that i could use the spray by it self but it also mentioned the liquid acrylic sealer (in the little jar) maybe that was the problem ?  or maybe it was just the brand ?  this is my first time painting on a phone case btw !  thanks !  !  ! ,1

fabric paint and shoes question feel free to direct me to a better sub if this one isnt the right place on monday as a craft project i gave my daughter a pair of canvas shoes and some fabric paint and let her go to town ive used the paint before and knew it needed 72 hours to dry but i always err on the side of caution and wait four days before washing and have never had an issue however the shoes we picked have rubber toes and obviously the sole that she also painted these areas are still tacky but i figured if i washed as normal it would wash it off now im left with even tackier paint on these areas my question is is there a way to dry the fabric paint thats on the rubber ?  and if not best suggestions to remove the paint from these areas ?  they are just cheap white shoes from the hobby store but she is so excited waiting for them to be ready so id like to salvage them if possible thanks for the help ! ,1

creating a garbage can out of a perfect-sized cardboard box how can i strengthen it ?  i have a cardboard box (actually a case of beer) that is the perfect size for a space i have in a pull-out drawer i havent been able to find any garbage cans that fit it and the beer case works perfect - except for the idea that liquids soften the cardboard and eventually bleed through it i want to flair the top (so the top is larger than the bottom) and harden it what out there might help me harden the cardboard so i dont have to keep recycling it (not to say buying more beer isnt a bad thing) i dont need to see what the case is but obviously dont want something that is going to permanently smell i also dont want to spend a ton of money (like casting it or something) would something like modge podge or is there a glue or paint that people think might work ?  lacquer seems a tad expensive for this thanks all :),1

question: diy chips dispenser first of im not sure if these kind of questions are ok to ask here if not please direct me to a more suitable subreddit :) &#x200b; im trying to build a very simple chips/doritos dispenser it is not supposed to be very sturdy since it will be more of a gag project but i would like it to be at least somewhat functional so im planning on just building it out of cardboard or some very thin/cheap plywood im still in the drawing phase but im already stuck on a problem for which id like your input &#x200b; the main problem im facing when thinking about it is how to get the chips out of the dispenser without locking the dispenser crushing the chips or fail to dispense all of the chips i had some initial ideas but after some thought they all had a problem that would make the dispenser impractical to use &#x200b; idea 1: just make a sort of chute you can pull out from the front making the chips fall straight down problem: closing the chute would break the chips still stuck in between the chute also dosing the chips would be difficult since they wouldnt start falling until at least a large portion would fit through the hole &#x200b; idea 2: have a sort of rotating horizontal windmill like structure that pushes stacks of chips in between the spokes over a hole making them fall out problem: rotating the chips over the floor of the structure would likely also break them and (since it will be a low budget contraption) the chips will get stuck in between the spokes and the floor moving all the chips at once would put stress on the spokes either bending them i could solve this by reducing the amount of chips in each section but then it would need some way to refill empty sections and this is a recursive problem :p &#x200b; idea 3: i experimented with a sort of tilting bucket like system where you could turn a knob from the outside tilting a chips-filled container that drops the chips straight down problem: i have had little success with dosing the amount of chips falling out &#x200b; idea 4: have the chips in a hopper feeding a simple conveyor belt that can be turned dropping the chips at the end problem: this sounded complex to build out of cheap materials (read: cardboard) and im not sure this would be any better than the first idea with regards to crushing chips when they enter the conveyor belt since if i can get them falling onto a conveyor belt i could just use that system to drop them out of the dispenser in the first place &#x200b; i have seen videos where they dispense pringels (or other roundish chips) by having them sit on rotating tube that makes them fall when rotated however i think (i havent tested it yet) that this wont work for non-round shaped chips since the center of gravity of the chips wouldnt necessarily be directly over the tube also if at all possible id like the dispenser to be easily refillable either by just pouring out a bag inside the dispenser or have it dispense directly from the bag this also doesnt seem to work for the ones i saw on youtube &#x200b; if you have any tips/hints/thoughts on how i could go about doing this that would be greatly appreciated,1

realistic heart in a bottle ?  fantasy potion shelf project im making a fantasy potion shelf with potions of all kinds of color most likely ill just use water food coloring and salt however id love for some of them to have a little something extra in there ive seen a dyi for head in a jar but that required taking and merging pictures of someones head i wonder how can i do something like that with a heart ?  can i just find a good picture online and stretch it so it looks good enough under water ?  im definitely thinking a seethrough heart would be best so you can still see through the bottle thatd also make it a bit more ominous i think &#x200b; &#x200b; &#x200b; do you have ideas for other things than pictures i could submerge into these flasks and bottles for a cool look ? ,1

"any ideas on how to restore/upcycle this thrifted bag ?  i love the style of longchamp le pliage bags but they were always out of my budget so i was pretty stoked when i found this [pale yellow at a yard sale recently but the previous owner treated it pretty badly - it has no shape or structure left (she said its like this because she threw it in the washing machine) and there were a few stains but i was able to get them out the plastic lining inside is also shredded in a few areas it was only a few dollars so i bought it thinking that maybe i could restore it somehow yellow isnt really my colour so i was wondering if there was a way that i could ""cover"" the outside with another cloth preferably in a dark colour like black or gray i was thinking maybe twill or a sturdy-ish cloth i would still like the leather handles and details to be visible as well as the zipper the zipper is yellow but i figure i can always put in a new one and replace the longchamp zipperhead charm on it i also will see if i can replace the lining inside would you guys have any idea on how i could do this ?  im not trying to make a counterfeit bag at all - i just want to turn this thrifted bag into something that ill actually use also is there any way that i could get some structure back into the bag ?  maybe by sewing piping on the inside ?  im a beginner at sewing but im pretty crafty in general im open to any suggestions !  thanks in advance",1

"ideas needed - baby sleep pattern project ive been tracking my daughters sleep patterns from when she was about ten weeks old ive got an awesome [excel now (thats an older version - shes 21 months) but i really want to *make* something out of it (each column is a day so there will be around 700 rows by her second birthday - although i could make one ""thing"" per year so it wasnt so long each day is broken into five minute chunks but i could easily consolidate them into bigger pieces - probably wouldnt want to simplify beyond 15 minute segments though) i do lots of cross stitching so i thought about that but id prefer that it wasnt just something nice in a frame ive considered scarves decorative pillowcases blankets etc but then i get stuck on how to actually make the thing !  i saw [this amazing blanket](https://twittercom/lagomorpho/status/1149754592579600384 ? s=09) today and thats exactly the kind of thing ive been looking for but its knitting :/ ive never been able to get the hang of knitting or crochet - i dont seem to have the dexterity required i love cross stitch because i can easily count the holes stop-start the project fix any errors etc i thought about weaving / loom knitting but im not sure if id be able to switch between colours on one line before i go down the rabbit hole of researching double knitting  can anyone suggest another craft technique to produce my daughters sleep chart ?  thanks !

"a beginner seeking advice for a specific project first off apologies if this kind of post is generally frowned upon here i didnt see anything that made it sound like it wouldnt be in the rules but i could just be dumb/blind but anyway so i recently became inspired to recreate a model of this hat that a character ive come to really love and appreciate wears heres a couple images of the hat in question: to give a very brief summary (in case it helps at all) shes based off of a eurasian tree sparrow that appears in the old japanese fable called the ""tongue-cut sparrow"" and this hat of hers is modeled more directly after what those types of birds look like but with a more cartoony spin of course edit: in case it helps to look up more images/angles of the hat the characters name is ""benienma"" from the game fate/grand order while i would love to recreate it as an actual hat i dont think im quite ready to take on that challenge yet since i probably lack materials i would need such as a sewing machine however i would love to at least try to recreate it in some form which is where i need advice i dont really know what the best way to go about this would be that is realistic to my skill level ive done paper mache once when i was very young and a couple projects with the kind of clay you bake afterwards in elementary school thats about it when it comes to artsy stuff that i feel would apply to this so yeah i guess what im asking for is the type of materials tools techniques and any other information you all could think of to guide me on where to go with this project of mine again i apologize if this really isnt the type of thing thats supposed to be here but regardless i appreciate any and all feedback you have !  thank you so very very much !

"can you use varnish on musty books ?  i got the idea a couple years ago to recycle old hardback books into key holders this involves gluing the pages together and screwing hooks into the front cover originally i thought i would sell these however a large number of the books i ""rescued"" have that old musty smell and i know some people (myself included) are sensitive to that and i didnt want to risk allergies so the project fell to the wayside now my husband and i are planning to move weve talked about downsizing our stuff and he pointed out (fairly) the pile of books i have done nothing with id like to finish the project i mean i bought all the materials why not ?  but ive got to do something about the musty smell and lately ive been thinking maybe use a spray varnish ?  ideally that would coat the cover and seal over the smell ?  would that work ?  does anyone have any other ideas ?  i know theres a ton of advice on how to get rid of musty book smell like freezing them or using dryer sheets none of those work they have never worked please dont suggest them i need some sort of sealant or just throw the whole pile away",1

photo project - custom printing on tapestry hi all * i am trying to get a **custom print of a photo on tapestry** but cannot seem to find anyone or anywhere who offers the **fabric** or **size** that i want any advice guidance or recommendations would be helpful * i am looking to get a [black and white photo](https://iimgurcom/7sqwvfrjpg) **printed onto** a **thin** fabric tapestry almost like a [**canga (sarong)**](https://shorturlat/cehx6) but not as large * the photo is **177 x 137 inches** (1280 x 988 pixels; 72 dpi) but i would be okay with up to 2 by 3 feet if necessary (the photo is personal and the one included here is just a very similar looking example) is this doable ?  * i have found websites that offer custom weaving but my concern is i do not want to lose details in the image especially since the image resolution is not large so i prefer it to be printed onto the fabric--as in **ink on fabric** * i called around local businesses and one employee said they could iron a photo on but i also want the texture of the fabric (like the canga) the same employee recommended trying the site fiverr where i have posted a request any thoughts or recommendations would be much appreciated thank you ! ,1

"polly pocket making advice ?  i was born in 1999 and grew up on (along with barbies and strawberry shortcake) ""fashion polly"" the polly pockets that were three inches with real doll hair and rubber clothes i loved those but recently i learned about the old polly pockets and how they were compacts for kids to take anywhere !  i would have loved that since i personally had lost multiple littlest pet shops and fashion pollies in malls and restaurants so i saw a couple videos of people making there own i am trying to open an etsy shop and i want to ad homemade polly pocket compacts to my items they used polymer clay and tack glue which i have but i dont know what the container should be !  pencil and mint tins are too thin for my ideas so are the nowadays makeup compacts the best thing i saw around the house was retainer cases both me and my brother have one but it will be a couple of years before i stop using mine and many years for my brothers too be available for me to craft with so what items do you suggest and where would i buy them ?  ps if i buy a vintage polly compact and i heat up a exacto knifes blade and can that cut out all the interior furniture ?

"if you had to get graphics & text onto a tortilla how would you do it ?  background: a boss is retiring after 40 years and i want to give him a fun ""gag"" gift he is known for his daily email where he signs off with some random personal piece of wisdom (think jack handey in 100 characters) his love of tortillas and having a great sense of humor my hope is to find a way to giving him a bag of about 100 tortillas all including a different one of his pieces of wisdom printed on one side and on the other side any one of a bunch of digital pictures we have of him in our archive these wont be edible my only real ""requirement"" is that the text isnt hand written (in addition to me having really poor handwriting ive also found that using something like say a sharpie marker tends to tear the tortilla) so far the ideas ive come up with are as follows: some sort of digital printing like a direct to cake printer adhering the photo/text by having it printed on some sort of ""sticky"" paper (i dont want to have to cut around all the letters by hand though) printing the text/photo on transfer paper and attempting to hot press them onto the tortilla rubber stamping the text printing out stencils for each quote and using roll-on ink to create the text would really love to hear your thoughts as im generally not a very crafty person thanks in advance !
