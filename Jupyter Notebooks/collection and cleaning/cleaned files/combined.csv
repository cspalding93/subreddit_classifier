0,badly damaged exterior wall studs is this out of the purview of a relatively green diyer this is just one of the four studs that need to be replaced or repaired in our shed one of them is worse than this one but i cant access it at the moment all of them have the same damage from i presume termites but there are no termites anymore from what ive read sistering it would be ideal putting new studs on both sides and tying them together through the old stud in that case should i just leave the old stud there there are also the crossboards that are all in pretty good shape should i remove them before sistering the stud is there any danger in that i realize the stud itself pretty much cant be load bearing anymore but better safe than sorry thanks,0

8,need ideas for converting rain gutter into planter box for reference [photos can be found my wife and i are planning on listing out townhouse very soon we recently had to demolish a previously built addition in the back because of hurricane water damage (side note we essentially brought the space back to its initial state) weve been wanting to improve this back patio area for curb appeal but kept the existing rain gutter (image 1) in case we wanted to re-use it it seems though that the roof overshoots where the gutter would go by a little bit (image 2) so using it as a gutter would be a little pointless plus we dont want to put in too much more money into improvements to add a new gutter that would drain further out into the shared green space ive read about converting old gutters into planter boxes because its such a large piece and already spans the existing length of the back area and also because i do not have a reciprocating saw id rather keep the gutter intact ive seen gutter brackets at hd (image 3) and a case study of gutter/planters installed on fences (image 4) has anyone had experience dong something similar if i get enough brackets would it be strong enough to support the weight of the gutter plus some top soil and plants should i stick to air plants instead thanks in advance,0

35,"questions about building a deck i recently built a **free standing** deck for a friend we decided to build it without getting a permit first only because of the time frame that we were in and not because of trying to cut any corners we live in upstate ny and the town that this is in didnt have any specifications to building a deck just to follow standard code &#x200b; monday: dug 9 holes to code and poured our 6"" cement base tuesday: placed our 9 6x6 and re-supported until dry wednesday: placed our 3 double beams and built all the joists started to place the deck boards only got about 10 done out of 50ish friday: deck boards and placed 4x4 post for railings (with carriage bolts) saturday: finished railing and all touch ups &#x200b; beginning of the next week he got a letter in the mail from the town code enforcer stating that they noticed ""a structure that looks to be a deck"" on the back of the house etc etc etc now they wanted him to go through the permit process all is well we send everything in and he gets a reply letter it states 3 problems well sorta problems &#x200b; 1 ""please provide a letter showing what the measurements for the post holes depth and what was in place on the bottom of the posts"" it goes on to show different examples of how it can be done okay shame on me for not putting it on the blueprints so this is an easy fix/explanation 2 ""the middle center post of the deck needs to provide a bracket to support the post to the beam"" it goes on to say u can either place the double beam on top of the post and use a bracket or to notch out the 6x6 and place them on top and attach using bolts heres the kicker it explains it a little further and says ""deck beams shall be attached to deck posts in accordance w figure ( which is the notched way or the bracket on top of post) or by equivalent means capable to resist lateral displacement **all bolts shall have washers under the head and nut carriage bolts are not permitted""** the actual problem doesnt list the problem being the bolts only to verify how the center post is attached to the beam i have never heard that carriage bolts cant be used  and is this something that might need to be changed 3 ""all joist hangers are missing nails"" what i know for a fact a so certain fact that i would put my paycheck on it that every hole in all the joist hangers are full except the angled holes i have never heard of the angled holes needing a nail is this something new &#x200b; thanks for your time and help with anything that you have knowledge for ( and please save yourself the time with the ""check your local codes etc etc "" because i know the code i build my deck with the same methods about 15-2 years prior to this and not 1 single problem only difference being the size and the township)",0

49,freezing washer drain pipe background: my sister-in-law called me a couple weeks ago and told me that every winter her washer drain pipe freezes making her unable to do laundry she asked for my help and i thought id just put some heat tape around it and problem solved so i went over to her house and she showed me the pipe in question it runs out of a broken piece of the foundation and is totally exposed to outside weather my heat tape idea was immediately out for a few reasons most notably lack of an outlet and the location of the pipe complete with being half buried in the ground i tried searching for different solutions but could not find anything suitable or even a similar situation she said she asked a plumber who was out recently and he said he didnt really have any ideas outside of packing straw on top of it that didnt seem like a very good solution to me but using my own knowledge and research has led me nowhere any other ideas on how to deal with this or is the straw the best solution here edit with more info: after getting some responses here i called my sister-in-law and dug for a little more info she doesnt know anything about plumbing but connecting the dots it seems this is the main drain for the whole house the reason she noticed it most with the washer is the washer is the final connection before the line leaves the house she told me that when is gets really cold none of the sinks or bathtub will drain with that said rerouting the pipe likely isnt an option the house was built in the 1890s and plumbing was (very poorly) shoehorned into this house she said that when she had plumbing work done a few years ago they had to rip out the floor in one of her rooms to get to the pipes but the floor was fixed afterward - so even seeing the indoor plumbing at this point is unlikely this likely leaves my options at doing what is possible to the visible portion of the pipe in the picture,0

87,"what do you do when the electrical work is difficult to access cannot get to junction box wanted to install a panasonic whisper bathroom vent fan in my master bath last weekend - seemed like an easy enough weekend project that might take an hour or two after watching some videos and doing some reading our house is mostly one story we have one tiny room upstairs but the rest is just attic - which normally makes things easier in so far as accessing electrical is concerned however we ran into a serious road block - it appears our hvac system is on top of the junction box for the electrical work in our bathroom ugh im going to keep digging around the insulation that was blown on top of our ceiling but judging by where it should be (from measuring stuff) it appears its underneath the hvac which is sitting on top of floor boards what now do i need to install a new circuit just to make this work but even then im having trouble imagining how i can install a switch (our original plan was to wire the fan up with the shower light so that it would turn on when you turn on the shower light) because the bathroom current switches are directly under the hvac as well i think creating a new circuit might be beyond our diy skills but im not sure it also seems like overkill secondly - iirc from doing some stuff in our guest bath (which is immediately adjacent to the master) shares a circuit with the master i dont know if that might mean there is somewhere else that we can access electrical in the attic or not as i said i will keep digging around in the insulation hoping to find something but so far i""m not having luck help our tiny bathroom desperately needs a ventilation fan system its too hot (and humid) where we live to open the window most of the year and im constantly battling mold trying to grow in the shower and on the window (yuck) forgive me if im not using proper terminology (correct me if thats the case) - my husband is the one who mostly does the electrical stuff im usually just helping by holding something in place or whatever my diy skills arent really the electrical kind &#x200b; i imagine this is a more common problem for people living in two story homes when you need to access the electrical for light fixtures on the first floor - so im hoping there will be enough people here that can guide me",0

146,[help] picnic table staining problem [picnic table thanks in advance for any help from the diy community (obligatory long time lurker first time poster) earlier this summer i purchased a build it yourself picnic table kit from lowes for putting on our deck if youve ever shopped at lowes you always see them sitting outside of the store i had been thinking about getting one for the family so i finally bought one when they were on sale in july (if climate and context matter as we get into this question im in the us southeast) i brought it home put the raw lumber together with the included hardware relatively easily and let it sit on our deck for about a week it seems important to note that the four leg pieces are pressure treated lumber but the rest of it is not i purchased a gallon of valspar one-coat exterior stain and sealer the semi-transparent variety that promises 6 years of protection from weather (i bought the cedar color which is fine but it looks kind of orangeish in the photos i took) i sanded the wood and then applied the stain in a single coat after the table had been assembled and sitting outside for maybe 9 or 10 days total very little rain during this time period i would add the problem: after just a few weeks the table started to look blackened if you take a look at the photos youll see what im talking about with the weird bubbly black and gray shapes in the close-up and the black streaking in some other areas of the wood (the really light colored marks and spots are just sidewalk chalk from my three-year-old from yesterday) can anyone tell me whats going on here and what i did wrong and/or what i need to do to fix this is it mold the wood reacting badly to the stain im perplexed at what is causing this and after a couple months it only keeps getting worse thanks,0

364,"diy | how to install the incra ts-ls positioner on the ridgid r4512 table saw https://ireddit/cldbebug3zq31jpg hey guys i just recently installed an incra ls positioner on my ridgid r4512 table saw and i want to share the installation process with you inca was having a sale and i jumped at the chance this table saw fence is incredible by far the most accurate and versatile fence i have ever seen so let dive into the installation process ***\*please use this post as just a guide refer to the instruction manual for full details*** one of the downfalls from ordering this fence from incra is the shipping lead times which can be up to 9 weeks i talk to one of the incra reps and he said with the tariffs and high demand of the fence the production lead times were stretched to the max i guess that is a good problem to have so when you order be patient its worth the wait the shipment includes 2 boxes (at least mine did) one box for the rails and the other box contains the fence parts and hardware be warned the boxes are quite heavy with the stacked aluminum inside the instruction manual was one of the most well-written manuals i have ever seen each bag of screws and hardware where labeled and included in the steps in the manual so you can easily reference the corresponding part numbers 1 removing the old fence from the r4512 is super easy this fence is absolute garbage and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemies remove all the bolts from the spacer rail the rail bolts under the front of the table at the back of the table and the bolts holding the extension wings (the bain of my existence) good riddance &#x200b; [remove the rails and extension wings](https://ireddit/gltq4b6j3zq31jpg) &#x200b; 2 this would be a good time to give the table saw a good cleaning use an air compressor or a can of air dust to blow off any sawdust wipe down the sides and table with some wd40 also this would be a good time to remove any rust from the top and recoat it with some glidecoat 3 take the rail mounts and attach them to the pre-existing bolt holes you only need to use 2 mounts per side each mount attaches to the 2 end bolt holes of the cast iron top the middle mount is not needed on the r4512 only use the 3 mounts if your saw cast iron top is wider (grizzly powermatic sawstop saws etc are usually wider) space the mounts a 1/4"" from the top once there are spaced properly tighten the bolts so it doesnt shift when installing the rails &#x200b; https://ireddit/k31bvv5r3zq31jpg pro tip: there is absolutely no need to drill and tap any new holes in the cast iron top as others have suggested incra provides several different size bolts the only real issue i had was the back rail mounts but it wasnt really an issue when i figured out to just use the bolts that attached the old back rail it worked beautifully 4 attach the t-nuts to the front and back mounting brackets then slide the rails into place space the rail dead center of the table we will adjust this later [attach the t-nuts that accepts the rails](https://ireddit/gjjup4xs3zq31jpg) &#x200b; &#x200b; 5 tighten the t-nut bolts to secure the rail into place loosen the bolts on the mounting brackets use the positioner arm mounting brackets and clamp them to the bottom of the rails move the rail assembly up or down until the backside of the brackets are flush with the top of the cast iron top this is going to ensure the rails are at the proper height then tighten the bolts to secure the rail mounting brackets [clamp the mounts to the bottom rail and flush the top](https://ireddit/bseg5zcx3zq31jpg) &#x200b; 6 now its time to assembly the positioner arm assemble the stop knobs and insert them into the right side of the rails there are 4 stop knobs 2 on the front and 2 on the back [stop knob assembly](https://ireddit/qr8puqp14zq31jpg) 7 attach the glide pad to the bottom of the positioner bracket install the screw and nuts to each bracket then slide it into play on the positioner cross member leave the screws loose as we will need to adjust its position in a later step [remove the philm and attached the glide pads](https://ireddit/sste4ix34zq31jpg) 8 flip the cross member over and install the positioner into place you will need to space the positioner 11"" from the edge i used a large square and a ruler to get the exact spacing tighten the outside screws to lock it down [slide the positioner into place on the cross member and use a ruler\\square to position it](https://ireddit/zg12som54zq31jpg) 9 remove one of the brackets and slide it on top of the stop knob mount the cross member and positioner on to the rails then slide the opposite bracket and cross member on the backstop knobs then slide the cross member into the front mounting bracket [attach the cross member into the bracket mounts](https://ireddit/5lwbenh74zq31jpg) 10 slide the cross member back so that its spaced 37 1/4"" away from the blade i used the miter slot and measured 32"" because i know my miter slot is 5 1/4"" away from the blade this makes it easier to use a tape measure once the spacing is correct tighten the screws on the mounting brackets to lock it into place [position the cross member 37 1\/4\\"" from the blade](https://ireddit/hf1whs794zq31jpg) 11 attach the front mounting bracket to the positioner arm then slide the arm into the positioner note: there is a small lip on the side of the arm that slides into the receive lip on the positioner once you have those lips engaged the arm slides freely this can be a bit tricky [installed fence mounting bracket](https://ireddit/3k3hpujd4zq31jpg) [slide the arm into place](https://ireddit/uwhkzhff4zq31jpg) 12 slide the fence into the mounting brack of the arm leave the screws loose so we can calibrate it in a later step [slide the fence into place using the bottom t-track](https://ireddit/0byh6rth4zq31jpg) &#x200b; 13 install the fence hold down brackets into the front and back of the fence [install the front and back hold down brackets this prevents the fence from lifting up during cutting operations dont tighten any bolts](https://ireddit/iptk1lkl4zq31jpg) 14 time to make the new extension wings (my favorite part) i made the wings out of phenolic laminated plywood so they will not have any seasonal movement you can use whatever you would like melamine or mdf would be a good choice as well each wing is supported by a pair of cleats rip 2 cleats for each size and then cut them to width according to your spacings the spacings are going to be different according to the size of the positioner you purchased drill holes into each cleat according to the provided instructions in the incra manual attach the clients using washer bolt and nut to the rails make sure the head of the bolts you use is large enough to fit into the t-track on the rail measure the width and length of the openings and rip the plywood accordingly place the plywood on top of the cleats and fastening into place with l-brackets to the cleats on the underside &#x200b; [the plans for these wings can be found in the instruction manual](https://ireddit/uav7qfjn4zq31jpg) 15 final calibration * place a piece of 3/4"" plywood scrap into the miter slot and butt the fence up next to it adjust the arm and position so that its square tighten down the screws on the positioner to lock it into place * place popsicle sticks (2 stacked on top of each other) under the fence space each pair equally down the length of the fence * with the fence mounting bracket screws loose raise the arm until its parallel to the rails tighten the bolts on the mounting bracket test to see if the arm slides easily if it does not slide easily its not parallel to the rails keep adjusting the height until it slides easily this is a crucial step in the process or the fence will not work properly * slide the fence to 1/32"" away from the blade set the fence into micro-adjustment mode by raising the red lever on the positioner to the middle position rotate the red dial away from you until the fence kisses the blade lock the fence into place * detach the magnetic ruler and slide it down the arm until the zero marking is lined up with the line indicator in the positioner window hold down one end of the ruler and attach the rest of the ruler into place make a couple of test cuts and adjust accordingly [if you are interested in watching the full installation video you can find it here: https:\/\/youtube\/juyz5rsvwx8](https://ireddit/homuzfar4zq31jpg) thank you for reading and have a blessed day",0
365,removal of diverter valve help hello fellow plumbers first off i appreciate any advice here i am removing an old shower dial and its diverter valve in order to install a shower panel with flexible inlet hoses i might get lucky with the work as the shower panel hose fits the male hot and cold water inlet perfectly my question is mostly on the removal of the old diverter valve in a safe manner meaning i dont want my bathroom to look like a pool afterwards 1 is it sufficient to just turn off the valve on the hot and cold water inlet as pictured or do i need to shut off the entire water supply to the house to work on the removal 2 from the close up pic to my surprise the diverter valve appears to be screwed into the cold and hot water pipes as opposed to being soldered in do i simply just unscrew the diverter valve and are there risks for pipe breakage im a little worried about the old pipes and joints the top outlet for the shower appears to be soldered in though 3 there is a piece of wood in the background thats right behind the diverter valve assuming i need to turn the diverter valve for removal can i just cut the wood off without risking structural damage i think its just support for the outlet valve at the top whats the best tool - angular saw hope you guys enjoy my collage of photos thanks all https://ireddit/7efn8hen9zq31png,0

367,"simple open joint cladding ideas hi all - ive built a small lean-to style shed next to my house the framing is 16"" oc about 65 ft in the front and 7ft in the back (only 27"" depth due to space limitation) the back wall (towards house) is already sided with lp smartside panels but im thinking of being more creative on the other three sides - hence the question on open joint/gap siding i think it would be cool to have a modern geometrical look next to my traditional looking lap siding the main downsides are that some of the purpose-built wrap products - whether 3d grooves for drainage or to be used with furring strips - are insanely expensive and would be wasteful for such a small project the reason i dont like furring strips is that it seems like the gap would be excessive (at least 1/2"" behind the siding) and i have to worry about wasps/hornets in my area so my idea is to sheathe the entire structure with osb and use 30# felt to cover it generously perhaps double layers but rather than putting furring strips i was thinking about attaching each siding panel with a washer or spacer (like 1/8"") behind it and a nice looking ss steel fastener through the siding washer felt and into the osb (maybe the stud) its a small shed i plan to use lp smartside smooth (12"" wide) planks that are cut to right size (so 27"" by 12"" on side walls longer on the front wall) im thinking maybe 1/4"" gap between not sure what would look right until i see it two questions: 1) how long do you think tar paper lasts in the gaps only one side gets sun ill definitely have two layers in each gap 2) would the washers provide enough of a gap hoping someone who has done open joint siding before can chime in thank you",0

380,stuck on how to install a replacement window in this opening ive been slowly working the way through house replacing windows most of them are traditional wooden windows with a sash cord and so are pretty straightforward to drop in vinyl replacement windows however the last few have been replaced once before using an older system and i am not sure what to do pictures of the system here: from what have found out googling this is some kind of older-style replacement window the channels that the windows are running in are aluminum i would assume that i can just tear the metal bits out however since the replacement windows rest against the outer stop and the stop would be gonenot sure what to do and i cant find any non-destructive way to get it out so once i tear it apart im committed i thought maybe the best approach would be to tear the whole thing out and use a new-construction window -- its on the first floor and i have good external access to the window -- but id really rather not remove the outside trim and possibly siding if i dont have to thanks,0

435,an old school desk is new again a friend of mine had an old school desk she picked up at a flea market it was a cool design from the mid-20th century with an amazing oak top unfortunately the desk has been the victim of multiple artistic rehabilitations improper repairs and eventually left in the weather for an extended period of time even though the desk was complete it was really bad condition the project started with a complete disassembly i then moved to stripping off all of the paint first with a chemical striper then wire brushing and ultimately sanding everything smooth all the metal work was repaired then primed and painted with rustoleum primer and spray paint the woodwork was repaired sanded using a variety of methods from 80 to 220 grits and then finished with verathane summer oak and seven coats of a water-based poly gloss clear coat sanded in between at 220 and polished and buffed finally the desk and chair were reassembled and delivered back to its owners i could not have been happier with the result that brought this piece of americana back to it original luster and appearance check out how i did it https://youtube/kghtirfxtx0 #dadityourselfdiy #fixsomething #ryobi #schooldesk,0

475,"shower base and drain help full disclosure here i am a moderately ambitious diyer but i feel very much out of my league on this project so any help or guidance you can give me would be appreciated im working on replacing the floor tile on my 1960s shower that sits above my garage in our split level house my goal was not only to replace the tile itself because it was very old and pretty nasty but to examine the shower base beneath which i knew was compromised because it had started slowly dripping into my garage below ive pulled up the tile and it was very obvious where water was getting through (to the right of the drain in image #1 below) because the material in this area was soft and somewhat muddy / sandy whereas everywhere else it was firm and hard in the pictures below i have dug out that area to get to the subfloor beneath (which is not very rotted but definitely damp) i was also able to determine (im pretty sure) how water was getting into my garage below if you look at the third picture below you can see my finger pointing to a gap around this flange or whatever on the drain pipe i think this area was saturated with water and that was the release point for any excess water that came through this is consistent with what we were seeing below with water dripping down this pipe on the outside of it you can see a little bit of daylight in picture #4 and this is where my finger is in picture #3 where ive dug out all the way to this part of the drain here are some to show what im talking about so this leads me to a few questions: 1 how was water getting through in the first place my guess is that it was slowly seeping through my tiles in this section of the shower we had very small tiles which means a ton of grout lines it makes sense to me that over time those seals in between tiles were not keeping water out and water was slowly getting below below and here we are the water saturated that section and then the water found a release under that part of the drain shown in the pictures agree or think something else was happening here i understand it could also have been leaking around the mouth of the drain where the drain meets the tile either way that would be a tiles not being sealed well issue right 2 do i need to consider replacing my drain or is it likely fine one thing ive done before ripping up all the tile was to pour copious amounts of water straight down the drain and ive had no issues with water leakage below i really do believe water that gets into the drain is fine i think its just that i had water getting through the tile / base and coming down the side of this drain but if i were to have new tile with new grout and a new moisture barrier / membrane on top of this is my drain likely good to keep as-is or is it one of those things where since ive gotten this far i should look into getting the drain out i dont really want to do it ""just because ive come this far"" but i also dont want to not do it if it really needs to happen if you think this thing is just so old and its likely compromised in ways that im not realizing and it needs to go let me know 3 this leads to my another big question where do i go from here as far as getting ready to put tile back on i have done some research about using either a liquid membrane like redguard or one of the waterproof membrane ""rolls"" but is that something i could apply on top of this existing base (shown in image #1) or do i need to consider removing all of this old base and getting down to my subfloor my thought has been that most of this material is in tact and solid except where it was damaged on the right side so perhaps i should build on top of this layer in other words get my subfloor dried out and patched up then fill in the chunk that ive taken out (with what some type of mortar mix) and then use this as my base layer that i start rebuilding tile and if so what do you recommend doing next do i apply a waterproof layer on top of this and then some sort of prefab shower tray (like schluter kerdi) on top of a thinset mortar then put more thinset mortar and tile the biggest issue with this layer currently is that its not perfectly smooth since the tile pulled up some of this layer with it and its a bit splotchy does it make more sense to not use a prefab tray and to just refinish this layer with some type of overlay (keeping in mind the pitch etc) and then waterproof it and tile it or is that prefab tray a good way to go just because it has the right pitch its made of a good material etc i know thats a lot of questions but hopefully my general question makes sense: how do i get from where i am now in these pictures to a place that is ready to tile 4 obviously if i do use this base layer as my foundation on which im going to re-tile and if i do build on this layer just a little bit with waterproof membrane mortar etc then my new tile is going to be raised slightly higher than my old tile which will make it hard to seal around my drain do i consider something like one of these ""extend o-drain"" [kits](https://wwwamazoncom/extendo-o-drain-extend-o-drain-4-3-8/dp/b007bv6ed8/ref=asc_df_b007bv6ed8/tag=hyprod-20&linkcode=df0&hvadid=198111101494&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14607906552616376246&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012564&hvtargid=pla-351737196878&psc=1) that raises my drain by 1/4 inch or is that a poor solution do we just go back to point #2 and say you need to replace your drain if i do need to go this route of replacing the drain any kits you would point me to that make this easy or is this definitely a ""call a plumber"" step i recognize that removing the current drain might be tricky even though i do have access from below as you can see from picture 4 any other major tips or pointers you would give me any videos that are a must watch ive done a good bit of research but wanted to be able to ask about my specific situation since i am a

476,bathroom vent fan leaking water question hi i have a bathroom vent fan leaking water during certain conditions and id like to know how to fix it the vent opens on a north facing roof and it is on a slope the water drips back in the vent fan on the second floor when there is snowfall and then warms up and melts as winter progresses it will also happen after a shower and the steam is vented up the same fan it is only during these conditions that there is water dripping back in i had someone come in and make sure the vents were connected to the vent caps through the attic and it appears the seals are ok the insulation around the bathroom fan and the attic seems to be adequate too visual inspection of the roof from thr ground appear to have snow built up around the vent cap the snow doesnt melt properly due to location angle of roof some other cause i dont know what else could be causing this to happen under the environmental conditions described i should also say during summers with rainfall nothing out of order happens my question is what is it how can i get it fixed what diy stuff could i do thanks,0

525,should i remove insulation from the inside of my masonry century home i just purchased an 1888 victorian style home in northern utah one of the things that attracted me to it other than the price was that it had 10 foot ceilings hidden behind dropped ceilings i knew this because in some places the ceiling was dropped with commercial style boards some spots were dropped with drywall on top of some other type of board that resembles ceiling tiles i knew i would remove the drop ceilings throughout the home to get the lost space back what i didnt expect to find is that the home had all of the exterior walls framed out and batt insulation installed the insulation only goes as high as the drop ceiling or a foot above with vapor barrier between the insulation and drywall in areas where the ceiling is dropped with drywall there are insulation batts above everything ive read about masonry buildings says that insulating on the inside is a huge no-no because it causes freeze thaw cycles that damage the bricks the home was wrapped in aluminum siding likely before the insulation retrofit so i cant inspect the bricks from the outside without significant cost the question is do i take down the insulation to prevent further damage or leave it and hope that the home doesnt fall over,0

528,paver patio grading question when creating the base for a paved patio that sits right up against the foundation of your house what are some tips for getting the grade correct so water runs away from the foundation do you create the grade with the 4-6 gravel base and then use the sand to make a level base on top of that grade or does the whole patio need to have a slight decline to ensure all water runs away from house foundation also does using landscape fabric create any problems with water pooling or does it not really effect how water settles really looking forward to getting a project designed for next spring thanks in advance,0

536,how long do pressure treated deck boards take to shrink to final size tl;dr - decking lumber sat in garage about a month and then out on deck for a few weeks before being installed i still installed them very close because i didnt want large gaps once they shrink down to size now im worried i should have left larger gaps since they had already partially dried help this summer i started restoring our ~350 sq ft deck i decided to remove all the decking which was 2x4 boards with huge gaps between each this part of the project took a while because i was saving each board and removing all the nails to reuse them for garden carpentry type of jobs i also did the same for the railings the frame was in good enough shape to use again came to be that the joists were around 30 apart so i needed to put them in between i ordered my lumber pressure treated pine and had it all delivered at the beginning of august i installed the joists and used a stain and sealer on the parts i was keeping after sanding and power washing by the time i was ready to lay decking my job as a teacher had started again as well as grad school by the time i got to start installing the decking last week some boards had been out on the deck waiting to be installed for a couple weeks i installed them close (about 1/16) but some touch in areas im afraid i wont get a big enough gap now ive read about wood being so wet its oozing when you put a screw in it that wasnt the case for me im about half way done and am looking for advice before i start the half that requires cuts to fit around posts and the house should i go back and give them more space like 1/8 or am i good and they will still shrink enough to give me the gaps i want we hated the huge gaps in the original deck and wanted to avoid that edit: i live in pennsylvania it was a usual humid and hot end of summer now the temps and humidity are quickly dropping since its fall thanks in advance for your advice,0

579,easy privacy shutters for bathroom window made from painted rulers and pvc pipe ive had this up for almost 2 years already wanted to share my [diy privacy shutters which is my solution to a window that is placed at chest level right in our shower area the shutters allow us to keep the window open but also provide us privacy we keep the shower window open at all times to promote airflow and prevent moisture and mold since the previous owners did not install an exhaust fan (probably because they chose a window instead) the other bathroom doesnt have a window but does have a fan a curtain would be the immediate solution for privacy but it would constantly be wet the perimeter is made out of pvc pipes and elbows connected to fit the inside of the window make sure to take in your measurements to account for when the elbows slide into the pipe that shortens your measurements i didnt account for that and only measured the full length of each of the pieces and forgot that it still has to slide into the elbow and i will lose some inches but in the end i got lucky and it still fit it was good anyway because since it was smaller i was able to wiggle it in diagonally when assembled and i also made it shorter than the actual opening so that it can stand upright as i slide the window close on top of it to hold it in place i drilled holes along the sides of the pipe and these are where the pins go i took home depot rulers and cut them to size by assembling the frame first and then measuring from one end of the inner perimeter to the other end and used that measurement to cut the rulers this also makes sure there are no big gaps at the top of the rulers when installed then i coated them with white water resistant paint- similar to what they use on bathroom walls- i think spray paint would have been easier i did 2 coats by hand and that was the longest part one thing i would suggest is that the rulers that are on either end closest to the vertical pvc frames should be wider or fatter because the elbows prevent it from swinging fully closed so there is a larger gap maybe super glue two rulers together at the edges to make a wider one for those ends i hammered some stainless steel nails to both of the edges of the ruler leaving a big portion of it sticking out so it can be inserted into the holes you made in the pvc pipes since the ruler is so slim you want the thinnest nails so you dont split the ruler when you nail it in the rulers swing around if you want to open them or close them by hand exactly like shutters just make sure when you are measuring where to put the holes in the pipe that the rulers lay slightly on top of the other as to prevent huge gaps where people can peek through when you put it in the closed position to assemble the rulers i first put all the pins on the top side then i lined up the pins on the bottom and i closed the pipes together this was tricky since there are a lot of holes and pins and lining up i recommend a second person to help important: people recommended that i install an actual exhaust fan since airing moisture out with a window is inefficient so please dont do this if ur only trying to exhaust a bathroom if you like to shower with the window open but want some privacy and have extra airflow then this can be good for you note that i also live in southern california where keeping the window open is not a huge issue all year round,0

582,diy miniature tensile testing machine hi everyone i was suggested to share my machine here so i do it [miniature tensile testing machine](https://ireddit/exr702hz3kq31png) during the last 15-2 years i was working on a miniature tensile testing machine in my free time during my job i work a lot with materials testing and ive always been interested in tinkering so this project is a good combination of everything originally i started to work on this project because i was working with a machine which had a very poorly written software and i was not satisfied with it also the mechanics of that device was a bit poorly designed so i though i could improve this the presented project is still under development but the machine is already fully functional and works quite well at this moment there are two big challenges firstly i have to solve the problem with the displacement measurement for some reasons the caliper picks up some noise and i could not find the source of it so far whenever i connect the power supply to the controller of the stepper motor the numbers on the display of the caliper go crazy i tried different stepper drivers different power supplies but nothing helped so far i still havent tried to power the caliper from a separate psu so i have to check it but i suspect that the noise comes from somewhere else maybe i should shift the logical level of the caliper as close as possible to the pcb of the caliper and carry the already shifted signal to the arduino as you see it now the signal from the caliper is carried to the main box (with a shielded cable) and the level is shifted there i also have a plan b i recently bought a dro scale i have to figure out how to read the signal of it with arduino (i just recently received it so i havent really checked anything) and maybe it will be a better solution also it is more robust so it should work better with this machine secondly i want to compress the device into a more compact format there are already plans for this but i am very busy and i am also a bit short on resources (for example cnc and other stuff) i show a 3d-printed part in the video which i use to hold the shafts and bearings that would be one idea to make it more compact however i started to design something with individual bearings and l-shaped profiles but i still have to make some drawings measurements and some preliminary assembly to see how i can implement the new design [sketch of the l-profile-based power transmission \(gears and shafts\)](https://ireddit/gjfta2114kq31jpg) i made a video for you guys because it is more easy to explain it by speaking than writing a novel and it is also better to see the actual parts that i talk about[explanation](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=jsf6cwc6gti&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m&index=2&t=0s) this is a closeup video of a sample and at the same time you can see the evolution of the tensile curve: [testing of a steel sample (closeup view)](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=pnz2b1gsjty&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m&index=4&t=0s) i also have a series of videos where you can follow the project from the first iteration [playlist for the whole project](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=jsf6cwc6gti&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m) i was asked for the parts so this is the list with an approximate price in usd not all but all the main components are on the list \- base plate (laser cut custom design) - $35 \- nema23 15:1 stepper motor - $75 \- tb6600 stepper motor driver - $10 \- digital caliper - $8 \- circuits for caliper (dc-dc converter level shifter) - $3 $2 \- gx16 connectors (34 and 5 poles) - $10 \- 5 kn load cell - $62 \- ek08 support bearing (for the shaft for the worm gears) - 2 x $13 \- crosshead pieces (laser cut custom design) - 6 x $7 \- 1m-20t worm gear set (gear and wheel) - 2 x $12 \- twin lead screw with nuts - 2 x $ 42 \- custom made grips (cnc custom design) - 2 x $53 \- pillow bearings - 2 x $265 \- bk10 support bearing (main bearings for the lead screws) - 2 x $12 \- arduino and other circuits (uno nano hx711) - $3 $2 $12 \- power supply - $15 \- plastic box - $8 \------------------------------------- sum \~ $550 but this is a very rough estimate since the price of the custom made parts can vary i also havent considered the cost of the tools and small parts that i already had at home or i actually had to buy small screws spare parts wires soldering stuff etc furthermore the hours i spent on design programming assembling and disassembling this several times etc the reality is more close to $1000 if you want to buy everything from a proper seller and in high quality i bought most of the stuff from china from random sellers from alibaba (in fact i am very satisfied with them and those products) and from other mostly chinese websites the system is capable of measuring much larger forces (about 20 kn) easily but based on the current load cell i am limited to 500 kg it is really difficult to find cheap and small load cells with higher capacity i am still working on this machine and hopefully i will be able to turn it into a nice product at the end the programming part is about 90% done (some improvement can be done and i want some more fancy features) so most of the work should be done on the mechanical part i will do more tests with different materials in the future and i will also publish them as videos,0

621,retractable tennis ball stopper - cord length hi &#x200b; today i installed a fixed length tennis ball stopper in the garage some yt videos suggest to make it a retractable stopper by connecting the cord with the upper end of the garage door (eg [https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=0695k47qtdy](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=0695k47qtdy) ) which looks very neat since our car has a windshield at a height closer to the ceiling than in most of those videos (tennis ball hangs at lowest point possible wrt the windshield) what happens when i hook the cord to the garage door is that the ball gets pushed all the way in to the ceiling before the door reaches the final position how can i implement a simple mechanical solution that helps alleviate this issue i dont want to add any further arms or stiff extensions to the garage door but rather simply work with the cord itself and maybe a more intelligent way to route the cord along the ceiling,0

676,"advice on hardwood flooring repair hi we recently purchased a house and are working on pulling up or replacing carpet and id ""like"" to refinish this floor and keep it bare but im not sure if its doable it has dark very dark marks on it possibly urine from the previous owners dog i dont need it to be a perfect floor i just want it to look a little nicer without needing rugs or carpet id prefer not to use a drum sander if i dont have to it is a loooong way to home depot but if that is an option that will work and i can rent followed by an orbital and edger stain polyurethane i dont want to pay to have this done which will probably get me some flak i just want to make sure this is worth doing or if the wood may need replaced or stains too deep or wont restain well etc etc i have done my research but im not sure on this specific floor because of all the dark marks any advice is appreciated the pictures i have dont quite show how bad it is and there is no sheen on the floor whatsoever the pictures were t taken specifically to show this but its the best i have right now thanks",0

680,question - how bad is installing duct work insulation and a crawl space i was hoping to get the opinions of people here who have installed their own insulation in a crawl space our house has an older ac/heating system and the insulation on the ductwork has been there for a while i noticed that there are some spots where it is in pretty bad shape and has started drooping and falling off the ducts themselves look okay but there are spots where the insulation will need to be replaced how painful is installation is this something that is better left to the pros i would rather do this myself than hire someone in order to save some money but dont want to dive in if it is going to be a horrible experience i got one quote for the work and it came in at $700 which i thought seemed high for roughly 5-6 feet of insulation replacement,0

717,what is the best way to reduce sound travel down hallway/stairwell so i dont hear sounds in bedroom i just moved into a townhouse where my bedroom is directly on top of a straight staircase and down the hall from the master bedroom sound seems to funnel into this room from both directions the townhouse is all tall ceilings and entirely hardwood floors so even a song played in the entryway on the first level from a cell phone can be clearly heard from this bedroom on top of the stairs similarly music played in the master echos all the way to my room and downstairs into the living room (yet in the master bedroom you can hear nothing from the rest of the house) it seems to me that the issue is these long hallways reverberating this sound along white walls and hard floors rather than sound leaking through the floor or ceiling what is the best way to significantly reduce this noise travel in the hallways i have considered carpet runners but i wanted to get feedback from someone on here before i make any expensive purchases im skeptical that a thin carpet will make much of a difference are there possibly affordable sound panels,0
718,mounting a tv and floating entertainment shelf how should i go about setting up an outlet [here is a crudely drawn version of what the tv and entertainment shelf will look like mounted on the from my understanding it is against code in most areas to run high voltage (power) chords behind the wall so i am guessing i will need to install an outlet behind the tv and possibly behind the floating shelf as well this wouldnt be too big of an issue but as you can see in the photo the outlet dead center on the wall is a coax outlet the only two outlets i have on this wall are both to right and left of the coax outlet i would like to hide the wires behind the wall if possible but given the circumstances i am unsure if i will be able to while also staying in code i know i can connect a new outlet to an existing one but i am also guessing trying to connect a new outlet dead center will be troublesome as the two available outlets are likely separated by several studs if you have any recommendations or solutions please let me know i am fairly new to this so if i absolutely need to hire someone or just deal with some visible wiring i have no problems doing so thank you all in advance edit: thank you all for the responses i think i have a general idea of what i am going to do if all goes well ill upload a picture of the completed set up,0

945,kitchen cabinet gas damper struts not locking hi diyers i have just moved apartments and while the new kitchen has a lot of cabinets all fitted with gas damper struts none of them lock in any open position which makes everything a one-handed operation unless you support the open cabinet door with your head :) it looks like this: now its probably obvious to experienced people but i cant for the life of me find how to tell *locking* struts like those from non-locking and if its even a thing (*are* there self-locking stays like this or i just need ones with more load capacity how do i find the correct value so that they dont just pop the door or in my face :))  in my mind i wound be able to buy locking replacements say on aliexpress and gradually change them over any pointers to explanatory materials howtos rtfms and/or maybe an example of locking ones would be gratefully appreciated,0

957,junction box in attic i hope this isnt a stupid question i almost posted in the r/electricians page seemed like a bad idea anyway home is located in wisconsin ive been doing a lot of wiring in my house and in order to facilitate future splices for additional lights throughout the house i wanted to install a junction box in the attic its not covered with insulation posing any hazard etc i decided to start a new circuit for these lights there is one hot line running into it directly from the panel and connected to one other light the intention is the have a good source to splice into run other lights from in the future &#x200b; i am being told this is illegal and all junction boxes need to be accessible on the livable floor (for lack of better term) is this person confusing with simply having the box be accessible at all because it is i cant seem to find anything solid reflecting this language about unlawful attic j-boxes in the wisconsin electrical code but im not super well versed in this &#x200b; tl;dr i want to install a junction box in the attic is this legal or not,0
958,vinyl plank flooring - how would you tackle this set-up hi all im about to undertake installing vinyl flooring planks in two rooms that connect to a tiled kitchen separated by a marble threshold (probably the click and lock floating variety vs loose lay) the dilemma i face is my home is very open concept and im not sure how to handle this large room separation between kitchen and living room (1st pic) as you can see there is quite the height difference between the living room and kitchen about 3/4 inch (2nd and 3rd pic) because its a floating floor i also know i cant have the floor push directly against the marble and will need to leave a gap (pic 4) any ideas on how i can tackle this thanks edit: i have 2 kids and normally a big dog our late boxer is the reason im changing from carpet in the first place :-) edit 2: i now understand that most people say the right way to do this is to raise the floors but i have 600 square feet between the 2 rooms and im looking to avoid that by hacking another solution some awesome advice in this thread edit 3: okay okayim now considering raising the floor :-|,0

961,looking for advice on installing a return in my basement duct-work so im finishing my basement and it was suggested to install a return in the ceiling of the living room ive never taken on any projects involving hvac equipment and im having a hard time finding any videos that are my particular situation ive attached pictures to show the setup https://iimgurcom/zhzpwncjpg https://iimgurcom/8budnyijpg the length from the furnace to the end of the return duct is about 95 feet it was suggested by the gentleman finishing our basement to install the return at the end but we had a hvac company come out to give us a bid and he talked about adding an extension so it wasnt so close to the furnace the quote for just the return was $185 so my questions are: * is the return absolutely necessary * is this a reasonable price * is adding an extension necessary * is this something a somewhat competent homeowner can tackle themselves * would you suggest a good youtube video to help out thanks,0

965,splitting apart glued sistered rafters i became the fortunate owner of a dozen brand-new 22 long 2x10 rafters but they are sistered 2x10x16 with 2x10x10 each with a 4 overlap (sistered) section the sistering was done with some serious screws and construction adhesive i want to split them with as little damage as possible i have removed the screws and i tried separating one set using a few chisles as wedges while i was technically successful the glue did take a bit of the surface grain from each side with it (not to mention the gouge-channels the chisels made) is there a better less damaging way to separate these boards,0
966,can i drill a hole into a soffit to run the cable for a wifi camera im interested in installing a wifi camera outside of my front door my house has a brick wall and i do not want to drill a hole through the brick for the power cord (im fine with drilling the mount into the brick though) above the front door is a soffit that provides ventilation for the attic i have a power outlet in the attic that the power cord can reach i would just need to drill a hole through the soffit to run the cable is there any reason that drilling a hole through the soffit would be frowned upon i want to make sure that i wouldnt be messing anything up by drilling through the soffit i figured that it wouldnt be a problem since the soffit itself already has several small holes for ventilation as it is below are pictures of the front door and the soffit that im talking about i would install the camera above the top right side of the front door,0
967,"[plumbing] trenching and 200 ft of pvc to new water service im in eastern nc and a private water company is adding service to our neighborhood im looking to connect the house to their service i want to keep my irrigation on the well add a hose bib at the well and move the tank (or possibly go to a smaller one) and pressure switch to the well from my garage the first estimate i got was $3500 which seems high to me in the event that this is what other companies are charging then im thinking about doing the trenching and line laying myself to start with and then decide on whether to try and push through the rest of the work out get a pro to finish i guess my initial question would be on using sch 40 versus something like pex seems like it would be easier to just unroll the pex in the trench and be done with it looks like the current line from the well is pvc and im thinking 15"" line from the street my house is 4 bdrm",0

993,securing handrail posts into soil im looking at installing handrail in a family members garden and could use some advice im planning to use kee klamp (or a knockoff version): https://simplifiedbuildingcouk/handrail/kee-klamp-handrail for the railing itself unfortunately all the parts ive seen are for attaching it to a concrete path there is a concrete path in the required location but it is only 90cm wide so i cant use it to fix the handrail posts without making it too narrow for bins / wheelchairs / etc quick sketch: i have 9 posts that need to go into the ground this is my current plan: - i want 1m posts above ground so i think burying 50cm should be enough ill therefore need 15m posts - the ground is fairly soft im thinking ill dig down most of the way with a post digger then hammer the posts in the last few cm so theyre stable enough for the next steps - ill secure each in place with postcrete leaving the level a few cm below ground so i can surround the posts with grass my main questions: - do i need to worry about the tubes filling up with water and rusting the bottom end would be open to the soil so id hope it would drain away and the top will be pretty much sealed - do i need to attach anything the the tubes to stop them pulling out vertically or will friction be enough - do i need to drill any drainage holes in the side of the tube at ground level to let water out - the tubes are galvanised steel but ill be cutting them to length myself do i need to coat the cut ends in any way before they go in the ground,0

995,anyone use the ez-level for kitchen cabinets we used them in our kitchen because our floors are so unlevel (we fixed the uneven dips and peaks but then whole floor slopes to the front of the house) they actually made installation a lot smoother than using all the shims at the hardware store however now the cabinets on the low point of the floor are about an inch and a half off the floor the toe kick will cover it but is the ez-level going to hold should we shim under the cabinets just for added security it says they are rated for 700lbs so they shouldnt move when the countertops are installed but i guess i am just paranoid any help would be greatly appreciated and look forward to a post in the near future about our full kitchen remodel that has been going on since november 2018 picture for reference of the floating cabinet: edit: i should add that the cabinets on the other side of the kitchen are fully on the ground the floor apparently slopes about an inch and a half every 10 feet,0
996,"boarding up doors and windows with planks of 2 x 6 pressure treated lumber will this resist burglar kicks its only 15"" inches thick actual size sanity check before i waste my money and do something stupid im a total amateur and dont have many tools or an actual workshop just posting here because you guys might know the answer planning on boarding up some doors/windows on a property to prevent more burglaries (seems extreme but thats what i need to do without going into specifics) **i have a gap thats 31"" wide there is 2 and 1/4 inch wide wood ""frame"" on either side (kind of thin frame)** (and it goes deep so i could use long screws if i need to) **if i board it up using 2"" x 6"" (and ~35"" long) pressure treated lumber would it resist strong kicks (its nominally 2"" but in reality 15"" thick)** on each side id be nailing and screwing it in with non removable screws to that 2 1/4"" frame this is the wood i plan to use: https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/weathershield-2-in-x-6-in-x-8-ft-1-ground-contact-pressure-treated-lumber-253905/206966039 this is a diagram which explains it a lot better https://iimgurcom/du831japng i plan on painting over all the edges to make it a little harder to grab with a crowbar * question: would the above plan resist being kicked in its 15"" thick of solid wood only supported at the ends i mean strong kicks the type they use to kick open doors ive seen those videos where karate guys break wood with their hands so im starting to doubt whether this would be strong enough to resist hard kicks * question 2: if i did the same basic design but instead of using 2 x 6 wood i used plywood (either 23/32"" sheathing plywood or 1/2"" ground contact plywood) would it be equally strong more strong less strong * question 3: what if i combined the wood and the plywood would it then resist kicking i would nail the plywood to the wood and sloppily glue the plywood to the wood (i dont have clamps so the glue may not be strong) * question 4 what about just plywood like question 2 but 2 stacks glued together (i dont have clamps so the glue job wouldnt be high quality id probably just put random things over it like books and whatever i dont have a lot of heavy stuff) thanks guys",0

1102,attic insulation diy questions hello im about to embark on my first diy project of insulating my attic i received some mixed opinions on quite a few things so i thought i would consult the experts of reddit to give the final say ive attached some photos and here are my questions: \- ive got recessed lighting throughout the attic (about 8 unites with 1000 sq feet) the lights seem to be ic rated when i look up the units online but they dont say anything about that on the actual unites when i examine them in the attic its not super easy to get up close to them ( very small ceilings) i guess im just paranoid my question is: should i still try to air seal these with a cover or will i be okay \- if i choose not to seal the recessed lights how should i go about marking where they are since ill have about 12 inches of insulation and theyll be covered also how would i go about marking other things like fans or electrical boxes is that something that is normally done \-theres a bunch cables scattered throughout as well as electrical boxes \- can the bathroom fan unit be covered with cellulose insulation as well i assume theres no fire hazard there thank you all,0

1114,advice on laying a floor over concrete a little over a year ago i started looking into converting our garage into a workshop the walls are single breeze blocks and the floor was unsealed concrete but unfortunately after sealing the floor life got in the way and the project was shelved fast forward to now and im eager to get the job done especially before the cold / damp really kicks in this year i work as a cabinet maker so have a fair understanding of tools / wood but apart from putting up a small stud wall a few years back ive never done any constructional work i figured id start on the floor as its likely the easiest part then move onto the walls from there my goal is pretty much to copy what this guy has done [here](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=dr8sqpguwzm) - 2x4s laid across the floor fill the gaps with some insulation slap a vapour barrier down over the top and cover the whole thing with 18mm sheets leaving ~10mm around each edge my main questions here are: 1 how should i secure the shims / boards to the floor he says in the comments something about spaghetti screws but i cant seem to find that outside of australia 2 he puts plastic under the shims which makes sense but then if you screw through that wont the screw break the seal 3 he also fills the gaps between the shims with what seems like [sikaflex](https://wwwuksealantscouk/sikaflex-ebt-adhesive-sealant-fillerhtml) although im guessing at which type exactly im going to have lathes / bandsaws running on parts of the floor so im thinking itd definitely needed in some places but doing the whole floor with it would cost a fortune any other suggestions 4 anything else ive missed or any other advice greatly appreciated,0

1116,need help/advice on retaining wall project our home is build on about 5-6 feel hill taller than our neighbors behind us when i bought my house the property behind us had tall trees and foliage to sock in our yard with shade green and just peace recently the neighbor cut down all the trees and wants to build another house behind us this really screwed us because my yard sharply drops off about 1-2 foot from our actual property line in some areas and the top of our fence is only about 4 ft from the yard level where the yard is ive gotten a few quotes and having a professional do a retaining wall to raise our property so we can actually put a normal size fence up is too expensive i am going to have to do this myself terrifying but also after watching youtube i feel like i could do it i just have a few specific questions that i was wondering if anyone can help with there are already stones that are relatively flat that come up about 1-2 ft from the previous owners of the house that is on our property line the current fence is 1-2 ft in front of that so the goal would be to build that wall up fill it with dirt and put a new fence where we get all our land and fence height all the videos ive seen talk about digging your base and setting gravel/blocks at the bottom about ~9 under ground level my neighbor said that he thought they did that with these stones but i have no real way of checking 1) how can someone check previous stones to see if its a good base to build a wall on top of i was just gonna dig in front of it and see if it laid properly 2) if its a good base would it be better to build the wall on top of that (would definitely be easier) or is it always best practice to rip up old stone and start fresh 3) if i have to start fresh how on earth am i supposed to get the original stones out jackhammer 4) if i use the original base what can i do to make my first level of stone secure and level i was thinking of mortaring the first blocks on the stone and putting drain pipes in any help would be appreciated edit: some guys at church were saying that since my stone base is pretty stable (i think) i can just mortar the first level of blocks to the stone and make sure that the first row is level id make sure to put drain tubes throughout and am planning on putting a drain pipe at the base of 6 of gravel behind the wall drainage shouldnt be a problem thoughts from handy men and women who know this stuff more than me,0

1136,"looking for cement board vs membrane advice for tiling over wood subfloor on top of my fired contractors screwed up attempt good morning i have an old ass house built in 1932 and im wanting to tile the floor of what will become the mud room hired a guy who seemed legit and claimed plenty of experience w/tiling i have since learned otherwise and let him go unfortunately i was dumb enough that it took him fucking up half the tile job for me to figure things out so dear diyers of reddit now ive got some questions this is all happening on a wood floor on wood joists : diagonal lumber sub floor with plywood over the top the real issue is that the floor had/has linoleum over the plywood about a 2/3s of which was removed when asbestos mastic was discovered the whole floor was then covered in an encapsulate and then half-assed leveled by my former contractor the floor is lumpy and saggy as we all get to be when were almost 100 years old squeaks like hell when you walk around so theres obvious movement happening my plan is to rip out the shitty tile scrape the floor down a bit *correctly* pour on leveler and then do the tile im fine with a membrane solution like ditra or a traditional durock product that being said the 1/8"" thickness of ditra and the ease of installation make it seem like a better choice even at the higher price but im concerned about whether it will be the strongest option considering the age and condition of the floor in general durock gets screwed into the subfloor so i think it may be better able to resist the flexing that im sure will still be present even after the leveler is applied any advice thanks [https://wwwschlutercom/schluter-us/en\_us/membranes/uncoupling-%28ditra%29/c/m-u](https://wwwschlutercom/schluter-us/en_us/membranes/uncoupling-%28ditra%29/c/m-u) [https://wwwusgcom/content/dam/usg\_marketing\_communications/united\_states/product\_promotional\_materials/finished\_assets/durock-cement-underlayment-board-submittal-en-cb250pdf](https://wwwusgcom/content/dam/usg_marketing_communications/united_states/product_promotional_materials/finished_assets/durock-cement-underlayment-board-submittal-en-cb250pdf)",0

1188,custom shower pan issues alright so we need a custom size shower pan and have the intention of pouring a custom one with mortar i know i need a ratio of 5 part sand to 1 part concrete but also understanding the commercial quikrete sand/concrete 60lb bag is a 3:1 the main issue: pan is going on a concrete floor in a basement we had the pipes put into the floor and everything is already sealed and concrete has been poured over the top but it was done wrong and our show drain is now level with the basement floor not elevated to allow space for the first pour is it best to: a) do the first pour and narrow it down feather thin to the drain use additional specified epoxies and hardeners from the manufacturer and continue on with the membrane and second pour b) do the first pour but leave a few inches around the drain itself to avoid the feather thin mortar fill said area with caulk/epoxy under the shower membrane ive looked at shower systems too but same issue i cant find any special part to partially extend the pvc drain up and allow the needed clearance need to know what would be best to have under all those layers so i dont have a shift underneath that ruptures my shower membrane or causes total collapse on my tile floors once finished,0

1236,"need help making modifications to a temporary window in my apartment (details inside) long story short my window broke several months ago due to construction my landlord has been doing instead of owning up to it and fixing it he made everything complicated by making up his own version of events and now were going through a lot of court related stuff to try and get someone to order him to fix it ive prefaced by typing that out so you can understand that the window was broken the inner pane was broken and the outer pane was cracked all kinds of noise was leaking through the cracked/broken window but it wasnt too bad you couldnt hear much from outside when there was noise on the inside this week my landlord finally got someone to come out and take a look they removed the window completely ""while waiting on a new window to come in"" and said it would be several weeks until they could come and install to hold me off in the meantime the guy put a temporary window (just a board of plastic it seems) and jammed it in there and held it in place using foam tubes the problem is this board of plastic is 10x worse than the cracked window you might as well have no board at all the noise just jumps out from the inside i need some tips if possible to insulate or jam the space between the plastic board (window) and the frame there is a space there about 1-15 inch thick picture: https://iimgurcom/aaz7se6jpg ive attached a picture to help you see the window ive taped around the sides just in case there were any gaps leaking sound to the outside it helped a tiny bit but tape isnt going to block out anything as we all know i dont mind completely blocking or putting something up that would prevent me from using the window itself i can use the one right next to it which is intact so guys are there any cheap options to help me retain some privacy using this temporary window ive thought about going out and buying acoustic panels/foam but i have no idea how good those things are and people keep complaining thanks for any help or tips in advance",0

1306,tricky landscaping issue with townhouse hello i have a conundrum of what i should do landscaping-wise on a tricky spot in front of my house i live in a row of townhouses built in 1986 the developers decided to build on a hill and step the foundations down between every other unit or so which puts my foundation a little of a foot above my neighbors im redoing the front landscaping and discovered that previous owners were very careless [imgur they built a pseudo retaining wall up against the neighbors wall extending well above their foundation making a nice dark moist area ideal for termites - the wood i pulled out was riddled with termite damage and from the images above you can see the damage to the neighbors trim and i imagine it continues into her house my question is how should i go about landscaping in this area i imagine i need an honest retaining wall of some sort but am unsure how to proceed because of the neighbors property,0

1322,help building a collapsible sleeping platform for the back of my car hey there i couldnt find any project that matched what i have in mind on google so i thought id drop my idea here to see what you guys made of it basically i want a sleeping platform -- essentially just a low table -- to cover the back of my car with a board resting on that and the back of the folded down seats together forming a place to put a mattress ideally i would build it in two parts one for each side of the car so i can choose whether i want to use the entire back of the car or whether i want it for storage the final criterion that i want is that it should be collapsible and able to be stored compactly as well as assembled and disassembled quickly &#x200b; what i was thinking was build it as two tables one for each side of the car the tables would be made of a plywood (or similar) sheet with pvc pipe table caps screwed into the underside i would then cut pvc pipe to the right length and that would slot into the table caps to make the legs if pvc isnt going to be robust enough i could look at using steel pipe and flanges &#x200b; any thoughts,0

1363,can any of this deck be salvaged so my house had a deck when we moved in it was obviously split into two parts: the original part built by the contractor and a cheap addition added by one of the previous owners the addition put in by the previous owners is a death trap and is coming down regardless of what happens to the rest of it what i dont know is if any of the original deck joists or posts can be salvaged or not the joists all look fine but the posts have splits of varying severity running along the grain my hope was that i could just replace the rails and the decking boards but i doubt thats the right thing to do heres a link to photos of the deck: i have three primary questions: 1 can any of this deck be saved 2 assuming i have to tear it all down do i even rip off the ledger board and replace that 3 if i opt to build a smaller deck (likely) it will not run the entire length of the existing ledger board how do i handle that do i need to add siding back to cover where the board used to be or is there another way to handle it,0

1395,help making this utility sink usable its obvious this is bigger than me plug back in thanks everybody ~~in my basement laundry room we have a utility sink that was set up with only cold water and a drain that just basically let the water flow into a rusted floor drain~~ ~~since then ive cobbled together a solution for hot water and put some bilge tubing in to get it to drain better but theres leakage at multiple spots unfortunately i dont know the terms for the place where im draining the water so google-fu is not helping me too much~~ ~~heres a gallery of pictures to see what im talking about~~ ~~a couple problems: 1) the sink is 4-5 feet from where it eventually drains into the main pipe 2) the tubing it drains into kind of needs to be flexible so that it can get around a refrigerator we are putting next to it and squeeze behind the washing machine (seen in the pictures) 3) theres leakage at both ends because (surprise surprise) shoving bilge tubing into the hole doesnt magically make a water tight seal 4) do i need to find a way to elevate the drain tubing so it feeds downward into its final destination if so im in trouble because the bottom of the sink is fairly low and quite deep and the drain is probably 4-6 inches up not a lot of wiggle room 5) finally i have no idea what that yellow plug in the last picture is called and i feel like knowing that alone would send me on a wonderful internet journey of answering questions~~ ~~the idea is to be able to use the sink as part of a make-shift kitchenette it wont be cute but hopefully youll be able to wash dishes in it~~ ~~thanks for reading let me know if you have any ideas or know what that blasted plug is called~~,0

1428,freestanding patio roof advice hey longtime lurker here i just closed on a house that has brick veneer siding i was thinking of building a freestanding patio roof over an existing concrete patio since im not comfortable with attaching a ledger to the veneer even with those fancy bvlz connectors my question is can i build the patio roof freestanding and butt the roof up against the house or would it shift due to the elements and tear caulking off if so whats the closest i can get that patio roof to the house so it gives the appearance that the roof is attached to the house and allow water run off im in georgia and it seldom snows here like once every four years so i dont figure snow is a huge factor in the construction if this is a terrible idea i may just lay down concrete away from the house and build the free standing patio roof that way to complete mitigate my problem either way works if possible but the former is much more aesthetically pleasing to my wifes eyes thanks in advance,0

1431,"repairing old style drywall ive recently opened up a wall in my house but im stuck on how to go about re-drywalling it my problem is that the drywall doesnt seem to be the standard thickness its like there is an under layer of drywall (pieces are 16"" tall and maybe 4 ft wide or so) and a top layer of this hard substance which is about the same thickness as the underlying drywall total thickness ranges from about 3/4"" to 1"" has anyone seen this before and have any suggestions i found a thread on an old message board with what sound like the same thing ( [https://wwwgaragejournalcom/forum/showthreadphpt=84330](https://wwwgaragejournalcom/forum/showthreadphpt=84330) ) but there dont seem to be any discussions related to patching/fixing it was thinking maybe attaching small plywood spacers onto the studs and then regular drywall on top of it and patch/sand down as needed since the thickness varies https://ireddit/7obrq7narmo31jpg https://ireddit/ddqatql6rmo31jpg",0

1433,leaning garage jimmyrig i managed to patch up my semi-detached garage recently a giant dutch elm on the neighbors side had slowly pushed the entire structure off of its concrete base over the years and left me with a substantial lean/warp on my side so i built a support wall ripped out the original and framed and finished a new square wall in its place but now im stuck on what to do with the unsightly and uneven roof overhang do i cut it back how do i deal with the roof hip where it meets the overhang in the front or do i just hide it with some flashing [dropbox](https://wwwdropboxcom/sh/ncd24dl6h4el241/aacat-3rlxxbb2tzvacxi5lladl=0) please see dropbox pics - would appreciate any suggestions at this point as im stuck cheers,0
1434,is there an easy way to connect twp pieces of glass together with a small amount of room in between currently the best solution i can think of is to glue a magnet on each corner of the first piece then a metal connection point on the corresponding corners for the other piece with the thickness providing the necessary gap the gap needs to be roughly the thickness of a thick paper poster not a cardboard poster though,0

1436,sistering joists or bridging flooring deflection question i am preparing to lay tile in my 1930s constructed home the subfloor is structural planking with 5/8 nominal osb on top i plan on laying ditra and then tiling the entire first floor i have recently discovered that the living room joist span is on the edge of too far for l/360 deflection all other areas of the house are properly supported underneath with beams and the correct distances should i be doing sistering on the existing 2x10s or bridging with 2x10 sections between the joists the joists are in good shape not broken at all minimal knots old wood so probably better than most wood available at big box stores these days the wood is dry and not much creaking or squeaking just a bit bouncier than i would like and i want to be sure my tiles dont pop back off after all this work anyone have experience with or info on standard practices for correcting deflection without installing a beam what is the best way to lessen the bouncing thanks,0

1461,hated our banister so decided a change was necessary this started off with my wife complaining that she hated the existing banister because it looked ugly i decided that rather than spending money on getting a new one id try take the project on myself i started by stripping the paint off i used a heat gun for the pieces that i could remove from the fittings and for the posts and then used chemical paint remover on the parts of the staircase i couldnt take off this left the wood looking really old and stained so i was initially considering just painting it a different colour i figured id sand it down first though to get it a bit smoother i sanded it all down with the combined efforts of a random orbital sander and a detail sander this left the wood looking clean and new thats when my wife and i decided on trying out the natural wood look but i wanted to do something to protect the wood i looked into a variety of finishing products including different oils lacquers and varnishes and considered different colours too but in the end we wanted it well protected but as close to the natural colour as possible i settled on an oil based varnish which then meant applying four coats over the entire banister which took a while as i was only able to do it around my work and social schedule its taken a while to get here but it is finally done and now i think i feel brave enough to take on a new project in the house,0

1671,part of self-leveling cement still soft after one day my wife and i put down self-leveling cement to level our living room floor after our foundation was repaired a year and a half ago we had structural engineers come out and give us the go ahead that movement had stopped so we want to put laminate flooring down we put down the slc on a clean and primed concrete subfloor now that the slc has cured we definitely have parts that need to be grinded down/filled in i knew it wasnt going to be perfect and i accept that but there is another area that has me more concerned the last bucket that we poured ended up curing white instead of the dark grey like the rest and after 20 hours while the rest of the slc job has hardened this last bucket is still soft you can walk on it without sinking in but you leave a footprint on the surface when you do it isnt deep just a cosmetic footprint and walking on it barefoot it definitely feels damp also when i tried to sweep up the broom actually ended up sanding down the soft surface and when that happens the white top layer reveals a grayer lower level that is more in-line with the coloring on the rest of the floor i tried my hand with sanding one section by hand with rough sand paper and it didnt take long to get to a lower level that wasnt soft (could tell by the sound of the sandpaper) i dont think i used extra water on this bucket if i did it wasnt much i am wondering if i just got a bad bag on that last pour that had the wrong ratio of cement/fibers etc at this point do i need to just sand up that bad bucket and start over or should i give it more time to see if it cures and dries out a little more,0

1724,"barn door dilemma -- sizing for logistical reasons we want to change out a traditional door for a barn door but the size is a bit odd the interior of the frame is 36 x 80ish but the trim takes it to 425 x 84 (approx) and due to the lack of space on either side of the door well probably need a double door the closest sized double barn doors ive seen at lowes and home depot are 42 x 84 the next two sizes are 48 x 80 \[too short\] and 60 x 84 \[wider than wed like\] this leads me to believe were probably going to need to get a little creative so far weve come up with two possible solutions: 1 use two 24 x 84 barn doors to make our own double door the hold up here is the price the best i can figure using two separate doors is going to basically double our cost even though doors sold as double doors arent really any more expensive ew 2 build our own door were fairly handy so its not a huge deal breaker we just arent completely sure where to start i would assume we buy a barn door hardware kit or the components of it (well cross that bridge if we need to) and then build our own door \[slab doors are apparently only available in 80 or 96\] i just dont know if theres a ""best"" material or blueprint for one the door is for a laundry room if that makes any difference to you im hoping someone has had a similar experience or has some advice theyd like to share honestly anything from where to buy pair of cheap doors to tips on building your own door would be appreciated thanks",0

1803,"another guy looking to do a diy wood fire pizza oven saw the ooni karu and other ooni products i loved the thought of having a larger than conventional oven as well as the high heat wood produces looking at a bunch of diy pizza ovens on youtube made me wonder whats the point of making it yourself if the oven is too small or you have to scrape out the embers to use it i mostly focused on the people who made them for very little money less than $200 as i would like to spend less than $150 if possible &#x200b; i looked up the ratios how the dome height should be 75% of the diameter of the inside of the oven the opening should be 63% but i didnt see anything on the width of the opening id like to do 18"" pizzas on occasion or long baguettes that are 18-20"" so id like my opening to be that wide so i was thinking about doing a 32"" diameter oven with a 24"" height 2016"" h x 20"" w opening (arched) if i want have the space to be able to do an 18"" pizza maybe the inside should be about 36 - 40"" instead &#x200b; the trade off i think is that the larger oven would take a longer time to heat so i might be less inclined to use it if it becomes a hassle to heat every time if i do more 10-16"" pizzas and 18"" baguettes i think 32"" would be fine &#x200b; so with that being said a few questions: 1 for anyone whos done this have you used it as often more or less than you had initially planned 2 what kinds of things have you found you cook more 3 what was the total amount you spent 4 what size oven did you decide to make 5 are you glad you went through with it 6 is there anything you would have done differently after the fact",0

1813,restoring old 1942 screen door and restoring an old 1942 screen door many layers of paint and lots of chopped and uneven paint in various stages of desegregation i took many/some coats of paint off with a heat gun then used a sander to smooth it all out all the crappy chipping paint is gone abut 1/4 of the door is bare wood now and the remainder is what i think was the original coat of primer - its holding tight and not peeling at all - so i let it stay my question now is - should i prime then paint - or just put 2-3 coats of finish paint on it (white) if primer - what brand/type thanks,0

1818,looking for info on building a frame off of a wall for cabinets we purchased some garage cabinets for our laundry room to replace our single cabinet they are a perfect fit my wall above the washer and dryer are 6 feet and the cabinets are 2 feet each we purchased new style samsung washer/dryer last year getting items out of the old cabinet was a pain because we would need a step stool to reach over the appliances we would like to build a frame that extends about 12 inches off of the wall for the cabinets to mount to it should be sturdy since it would be able to be anchored to the back wall as well as the sides im looking everywhere for tips or instructions to accomplish this anyone ever do something like this heres a pic of the old cabinet sitting roughly about how far we want the new cabinets off of the wall,0

1821,how to time halloween lights when my outlet is only 1ft above the ground sorry for the super simple question- im a total dunce when it comes to electrical stuff and i just want to make sure im not going to fry my landlords circuits or anything if it starts raining just got some outdoor halloween lights and strung them up and realized that because they dont come with an on/off switch i have to just leave the plugs hanging out when im not using them which already seems ominous- so i figured id invest in a light timer but all of the outdoor timers say they need to be positioned vertically at least 2 ft above the ground and my outlet is only 1 foot above the floor of my balcony and because the timers themselves look a tad long i think when i plug the lights into them theyre going to be practically laying on the ground which i can tell wasnt the intended position whats the worst that could happen if i just use the light timer anyway- am i risking my landlords electrical system or merely risking ruining my own lights and also what are my options im on the second floor so i dont see standing water being an issue but i want to make sure im doing this right and not risking anything important thank you,0

1879,led safety question from doing various google searches i understand that led lights are extremely safe bec of the incredibly low amount of heat they generate but can i assume there are still risks for example i once purchased a couple of strips of exposed leds from a dollar store they had an adhesive side and were designed to be attached to the back of a tv according to the box if i snaked one of these strips through a coloured straw and turned it on for a craft project would that be safe or would the near/direct contact eventually heat up the straw enough to melt it (ps not entirely sure if i chose the right flair feel free to change if its wrong),0

1946,help mounting monitor arm on brick so i recently got a big display tablet for drawing and since my desk is made of glass i thought of getting a wall monitor arm instead of a desk arm for which i would have to buy a new desk that could hold the weight we thought the wall was concrete (on the surface its just your regular white painted wall) but soon after we started drilling the white powder ended and red dust started coming out of the holes we tried mounting it with the regular plastic anchors that came with the set (we really dont know what were doing) and as we are tightening the screws we realized that not only was the wall brick but also that the screws are way too long and soon we hit a hollow space behind the brick layer itself the screw already has a tendency to come loose but the hollow space making it tip over is even worse we attempted to add a wooden board in front of the wall to make up for the hollow space and it seemed perfect until we tried putting some weight onto the arm and the top screw started to loosen (the wall also seems to be more rigid on the lower portion) since the arm has to be able to come across the desk safely is there ever going to be a way that the wall will hold the weight the display is 16 lbs plus the adapter and the arm itself any clarifications or suggestions would be aprecciated,0

2047,vibrating washing machine makes things fall off hi diy so i have a tiny apartment most people have more storage space in their cars than i have in my apartment :) id like to maximize what i have (more background: college student so assume broke yes but not completely broke (because of all the money i save on my tiny apartment) also assume i dont know the names of tools or how to do much more than use a drill im willing to learn though and have friends that can help if i need a professional your idea is likely a bit outside the scope of what im looking to pursue i have a stacked washer/dryer with plenty of room on top of it as expected when i put boxes on top of this they sometimes fall due to the vibrations from the washer/dryer running i can fit a lot up there so i need to sit down and take the time to figure out the way to do this ive played with quite a few ideas ill spare you the really bad ones first here is a picture what i want to do is secure large storage bins to the top of the dryer or above the dryer\* example storage bins [https://wwwikeacom/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/](https://wwwikeacom/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/) others would be fine too if any advantages i want to be able to take the entire storage bin off the top to interact with the contents ideally id stack two but ill either have to test to make sure the top couldnt get thrown off/is locked in tightly enough or also secure the top bin separately my best (pls dont laugh) idea so far is to attach a hook to each wall (marked by the red xs in my pic the left x is meant for the shower wall not the back wall) then drill a small hole into each side of the bin then some of caribiner / detachable rope / dog leash cut to length unhook take it down rehook it will move around when washer/dryer on but cannot fall similar alternatives include a rope or bungie cord across the front but not actually attached the bin cant fall off but id have to lift it over instead of detaching (not a problem but the installation of this doesnt really seem any better/easier) or even something like a 2/4 installed across (this just seems like it would be uglier) shelves seem like a fail as theyd be quite far back i also dread the installation will admit there are some clear advantages though and could be convinced \*as i was editing this post i realized its on top or above the dryer perhaps the best option is installing a platform that rests on the shower-wall and attaches to the right wall the advantage being that nothing moves at all when using washer/dryer which means no need to drill into/find a way to attach bins and easier to get them down and back up plus i could definitely stack them this seems like a much better idea if i can teach myself how to install something like this open to totally different ideas as well as implementation ideas/products if you think i should go with my idea i said dog leashes only half-jokingly; i have no idea how to properly shop for a project like this / what these items are actually called i can even construct something that extends all the way over the shower if you sell me on an idea there is another 18 inches to the left in the provided pic i can provide exact measurements and additional pics if useful thank you for reading really looking forward to this appreciate any advice or random tips no matter how small i promise updates and cute pics claire,0

2122,chair in apartment bedroom uneven due to warped and sunken floor how should i deal with this [here](https://iimgurcom/it0a71qpng) is a very rough diagram of the situation basically the floor in this room of an old apartment is severely warped with several sunken areas and a differential of probably close to two inches from the lowest to highest points of my desk/chair area unfortunately this is the best spot in the room for my desk i doubt my landlord would do anything about it and even if he was willing to call in a professional it would be a huge pain for me i would probably have to move all of my furniture out for awhile as the room is on an overhang of the building and would likely require a lot of annoying work for the professional to come and fix its honestly slightly worrying in a long term structural integrity sense but hopefully there wont be any issues during the course of my lease for the desk itself i somehow managed to get it level with a combination of furniture pads for height and furniture leveling shims for the angles but the chair obviously remains tilted from one end of my plastic chair mat to the other there is probably at least half an inch of sinkage total this is rather uncomfortable as the front left of where the chair is resting is a sunken area and causes the chair to roll a bit and tilt in that direction i considered making or rather getting a carpenter or someone else to make a plywood platform with furniture levelers for the entire desk area but it would have to be pretty heavy duty to support everything and im not sure if it would be worth the cost and the effort of moving everything it would also take up a lot of space very awkwardly in this small room my next consideration is applying the same tactic i used on the desk (furniture pads and leveling shims) to the bottom of the chair mat to get things somewhat level and stuffing something underneath it to fill the gaps and make it relatively stable would this be a good idea if so what would be a good material to stuff underneath the mat if not what would be a good alternative solution any input would be appreciated edit: several people have suggested putting a sturdy piece of plywood or other type of board under the chair this is fine but i still have my concern of the board snapping or bending without any padding filling the gaps is there something i could use to fill in the empty space between the board leveled with shims and the floor,0

2185,how to attached large joists to a notched ledger board over windows hello i am in the process of replacing a very shottily built deck on my house (i am in the us) the old deck was held together by way too few and way too short of hardware--as well as virtually no treated lumber most of it rotted away when tearing it apart or the (non galvinized) hardware rusted and sheared in half i am shocked it supported the weight of the snow over the last winter after purchasing the house i planned on making the new deck larger (20 wide x 18 from the house) and thus went with much larger lumber the old deck was using a 6 ledger board and 6 joists (roughly 13 ft from the house and 15 ft long) the new deck i am moving to 2x12 ledger board and joists 16 center with a 4x12x24 beam bolted to four notched 6x6 posts for outer support w/ a small overhang my question is--the new ledger board overlaps two basement windows (split level house) as show in [this picture](https://iimgurcom/7spyrpbjpg) how would i go about attaching my joists to these areas best i can tell ill have at least 2-3 of these joists over each window and ill have 6-8 of meat to attach to here are my options as ive seen them so far please let me know if im missing something or if im even in the ballpark - i put two 12 joists on each side of the windows 6-8 off center with bridge blocking to strengthen up those areas and run notched joists over the windows - i notch my 12 joists to the size of the available ledger board and use smaller joist hangers (im concerned about a corner load on this option) - i cut a 45 degree angle into a 12 joist and notch only the part sitting in the joist hanger to minimize the corner load - i hang smaller 6-8 joists in these shorter areas (this would also be an issue since they other end would not be sitting on the beam at the same height as the 12 joists any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated i cant find much info online with installing a deck with windows in the way and theres nothing in the 2015 intl residential code (that my city uses) that answers this question my neighbor thinks i am overthinking it since im using 12 joists everywhere else on the deck but i am not as confident also i am aware the bottom ledger board hardware isnt installed yet--i didnt take into considering that id be going into my foundation wall thank you edit: the windows are 44 1/2 long,0

2199,total diy novice here new radiator will be wider than the distance between the pipes from current towel heater is there a way to extend the existing pipes coming through the floor to the correct position rather than ripping up my laminate flooring im a complete novice here diy hasnt been something ive ever really done but my house is freezing in the winter and is currently full of single panel radiators so im upgrading to double panels (type 22s) which should help ive made sure to buy radiators that are the same width as the current ones so i shouldnt need to do anything to the current piping the coldest room in my house by far is the bathroom and theres only a towel heater in there right now looking at other towel heaters the btus are nowhere near close to what a similar sized radiator could offer so this absolutely needs replaced the problem is that the pipes on the towel heater go directly in to the bottom of it whereas a new radiator will need them to be further apart to go in to the sides where the inlets are so from my novice perspective i have two options and this is where i need clarification and help from you guys i can either take up the laminate flooring and try to do it the normal way but ive no clue what im doing there and theres a risk of breaking the laminate flooring this way (which i can nowhere near afford to replace; im only able to get the radiators because there was a clearance sale on near me and i got about 75% off them) my other option (and this is what i want to know if its possible and if so what i need) seems to be to just extend the current piping similar to in this professionally made artists impression i had commissioned: https://iimgurcom/tzbnpctpng is this doable (without welding) my only lead is some vague mention of an elbow on some forum somewhere (one of these: https://wwwscrewfixcom/p/tectite-sprint-copper-push-fit-equal-90-elbow-15mm/6486g ) im also worried that a setup like this would be more prone to leaks is this a legitemate concern or is it just as unlikely this way any help on what my options are and what i need for that would be appreciated,0

2253,suggestions re pimping motorcycle with loud sound for annual local pilgrimage a local annual pilgrimage takes place in which loads of bicycles come together to do bike ride together its common for bicycle owners to go creative and come up with funky air-horns and any sort of audible device below is just a setup ive done for couple of times basically it has to last throughout the event which is approx 3-4 hours apart from weight which to be fair was never an issue theres the heat and power supply concerns 12v compressor sucks up energy like a b\*$# and even worse is that everything heats up pretty quick sometimes it has to be left for durations of half-an hour to actually start working again after cooling down eventually it stopped during the last use only to find out that the brushes warmed up so much that they softened the plastic housing through which they slide to contact the armature and got stuck instead of springing as intended apart from bicycles on the same event theres a second group following along which consists of motorcycles which is were my question lies basically thought of doing some sort of setup to the motorcycle this time bikes a honda crf250l 2014 model am looking for suggestions for the below: \- what would be louder/smarter: air horns setup with 12v compressor/s or speaker setup with car head-unit not sure about small multichannel amplifier - either way i have to keep in mind heat concerns as everything will heat up no matter what so thermal cut-offs will ruin the plan \- as a power source would you suggest an external/extra car battery mounted on the bike and power is sourced through it directly also would you plug power from the bikes stator to the battery as to charge it or would you do without the extra battery and source everything through the bikes power source generation - would any use of the stator be too much for the bikes electric recharging system since it might be too much or the battery too big to recharge all along so no matter what i dont want to harm the bike in any way this is just an annual event yet adding some spark to it makes it a whole different thing :) &#x200b; this is a link for the mounted kit on the bicycle : [https://wwwebaycouk/itm/12v-duke-of-hazzard-dixie-land-dixieland-musical-tune-car-van-air-horn-kit-set/163798194520hash=item2623221958:g:jjcaaoswg8xb1vqu](https://wwwebaycouk/itm/12v-duke-of-hazzard-dixie-land-dixieland-musical-tune-car-van-air-horn-kit-set/163798194520hash=item2623221958:g:jjcaaoswg8xb1vqu) im after loudness re suggested setups temporary fabrication can be done to the bike to cater for equipment etc below is a picture of the bike:  suggestions guys n gals,0

2312,question about grading around foundation hello all i posted this in r/landscaping as well but i figure i might be able to get some input here as well since i have been stressing about this thanks in advance for any info provided: i purchased a home when there was still a lot of snow outside and didnt notice the following grading issue on one awkward part of the house the following is a diagram of the area of my house: &#x200b; https://ireddit/6n6ihpokyom31png the house has rock all around it the green line represents the grass line and the red question mark is the problem area grading around the other areas of the house is pretty straight forward (from what ive been reading about an inch per foot or some say 6 inches every 10 feet) however this area presents a problem because it is much further away from the yard and the roof there is sloped on one side so sometimes water flows off the side into this area adding to the rain falling straight down ive been reading online that you should maintain a 6-8 clearance between soil and the bottom of the siding to prevent moisture problems as well as prevent termites and mice however if i obey that rule grading from the corner to the yard would result in essentially a ditch a 3-4 discrepancy between the work area and the yard line i am pretty sure that corner as it is is below the grade of my yard currently as well without removing the rock to fully analyze looking at the grade on the rest of the yard it looks like its not possible to obey both grading rules above i initially thought of adding a drain there to drain water into another part of the yard but i run into the issue again where because that area is equal grade or lower to the yard i cannot slope a pipe down to drain and then run off into the yard swale it would be far underground at that point i am kind of at a loss at this point according to my calculations i would need to stack soil about an inch or maybe an inch and a half from the bottom of the siding in order to achieve a decent grade regardless of whether or not i install a drain there is that fine as long as the water runs off correctly and doesnt gather there for additional info: i have vinyl siding and right behind the siding is a white styrofoam like material that sits on top of the foundation,0

2475,"old worn out fireplace need some advice planning a fireplace surround renovation wanting tile and a new mantle and columns etc but gotta get to that point first so first thing previous owners of this house ""renovated"" and some walls they simply installed new drywall onto the old plaster walls instead of doing a full demo so things that are original like this fireplace dont extends out as far into the space as they did originally since there is an additional layer of wall so the decorative stone of the fireplace only extends into the room about one inch i expect it would be best to demo the stone and get down to the brick of the fireplace place some cement board and tile off of that but then it will be sunk into the wall unless i build it out somehow the stone used for the face feels sturdy and im wondering if i could apply cement boards to that and tile on top of it and if i can do that how do i deal with stones that arent flush to the rest most look pretty flat but then there are some odd ones that definitely arent flat and will cause some issue so how would i get the cement board to lay flat on the stone and lastly the hearth into the living room needs to be expanded a bit but its also taller than the floor by a good six inches any advice on building a frame for this part thanks all",0
2476,stucco (hard coat) damage so we had a stucco guy come out to give an estimate to fix lots of hairline cracks few moisture bulges on cinder block and woodpecker holes he recommended filling the cracks and repairing the other damage then he would put a new coat on the whole house to make everything look even he mentioned that the final coat will include krack shield technology to prevent further cracks from appearing does anyone know anything about krack shield is it a gimmick does it work how is it applied-do they use mesh should they put mesh (prevent cracking) on the old coat all over the house prior to putting a new coat thanks,0

2485,[help] stained base board refinishing - guidance needed hello all i am very new to wood working and would like some guidance on best resources to learn how to best touch up/refinish my base boards as part of the project to have my wood floors refinished i removed my base boards so that the contractors could access all of the wood floor boards and thought to take the opportunity to also refinish these boards the boards themselves seemed to have lost a bit of vibrancy and the original stain and topcoat were applied on the boards when they were first nailed onto the wall not separately as a result residue from this process accumulated on the bottom edge of these boards and there are areas where no stain was applied (these areas generally dont see the light of day but it annoys me none-the-less) the original plan to refinish these boards was to sand down the layer of topcoat and a bit into the stained wood then re-stain and topcoat the sanded boards below are pictures of this process (different boards at different stages) i apologize for the lighting glare on the boards original board: close-up of old stain/topcoat residue: board after sanding (120 grit sand paper): board after stain and topcoat: in general the board above came out decent looking but some other boards came out more uneven and blotchy i was recommended using a board conditioner before applying stain and have yet to try that i wanted to get some second opinions on the direction in case there is a better way to go about this am i approaching refinishing these boards correctly what resources would you recommend me using in order to better understand how to best refinished stained wood base boards thank you in advance for your assistance,0

2534,drainage pipe questions: perforated french drain or solid pipe with spill basin i live in tn and this year thus far we have had a ton of rain it has made the drainage in my backyard along my fence (about 100 feet) a nightmare about 4 feet out along my fence is completely soggy i originally thought of doing just a perforated 6 inch french drain inside some rock and fabric however with all the rain behind my tree at the corner of the fence there is some standing water multiple people i have talked to have said install a catch/spill basin in that corner and connect it to pipe and carry it out one guy said use solid pipe (no holes) that way as it catches the water in the corner it will carry it out and no additional water can be deposited in the soil so eventually it can dry out another one has said to do the catch basin but still connect it to perforated pipe (like the classic french drain) he says as the water is flowing it will flow too quickly through the pipe and wont be able to deposit any additional water to the soil and the holes will additionally capture any extra water from the soil first guy (solid pipe guy) said he has done this on a property he owns and it solved the problem but that his soil was never as soggy as mine is so what is the best way to go about this do i need to use solid pipe connected to the catch basin or go the classic french drain route (with perforations/holes surrounded by rock surrounded by fabric) connected to the catch basin note that the pipe will be underground about 100 feet or so and will connect/empty into my neighbors ditch that they dug for drainage my yard does has a slight grade over half of it both guys have said they will dig a grade into the ditch note that there may be an underground stream/spring somewhere (this seems to be a new development) do i need solid pipe or perforated pipe for this i want to carry rain through the catch basin while it is actively raining but i also want to help my yard dry out,0

2582,"[question / advice] self leveling underlayment corner so this is a bit of a long story but ill try to keep it short after crunching numbers and time investment i decided that pouring self leveling underlayment during my kitchen renovation would be better (for me) than tearing up the existing peel and stick from the 70s the sub floor and leveling it the ""proper"" way the house is really old and potentially sealing off any asbestos was part of the motivation to go this route we screwed up our first pour by going with a crappy product with bad instructions and following them without second guessing (which is our fault) leading to wayyyyy too thick of a pour leading to mounding / hilly-ness we tore it up and poured a different brand that suggest wayyy more water and we even used a touch more water than suggested the floor leveled amazingly compared to the first time through all that i still screwed up and forgot to tear out the door frame / trim as we intended on making it an open walkway instead of a door one corner ended up fine the other got busted up during removal [photos any of you fine folks have an idea as to how i might best patch this i have no intention of tearing up the leveler again lol thank you all for your time edit: just to provide as much info as i can we are laying 12x24"" vinyl tile with built in substrate on top of this",0

2701,question about insulating exterior wall with no sole or top plate the wife and i recently bought a house which was built in the 1880s that had an addition at some point in the mid 1900s knob and tube horse hair plaster all the good stuff weve gut one of the rooms that well turn in to the master and are now putting it all back together again as part of this were insulating the exterior walls since theyre open the building inspector was pretty clear about having a continuous vapor barrier on exterior walls (even though none of the rest of the house is insulated but i get it) however due to the construction of the exterior walls the studs run down to the first floor with no sill plate and up to the attic with no top plate ive purchased and stuffed the holes with rock wool per the inspectors suggestion but im left trying to figure out the best way to attach the vapor barrier at the top and bottom it feels a little pointless since the rest of the walls arent insulated at all but here we are im using faced fiberglass batts to create the vapor barrier but dont have anything to staple to the top or bottom of the batt to since the bay is just open at either end any suggestions,0

2726,need help setting up a baseball machine for my little brother so im off to college and my little brother is bummed out im not there to use our baseball machine with him im thinking of setting up an automatically feeder for him as a weekend project when i go home to visit in a few weeks heres the pitching machine we have from spinball essentially you put a ball into the ball feeder tube chute (red arrow) and the pitching machine spits the ball out with its spinning wheels &#x200b; [spinball pitching machine](https://ireddit/4tg0fxow7ql31png) now the automatic feeder essentially stores baseballs and releases one every 10 seconds or so into the pitching machine for you eliminating the need to have someone feed the machine baseballs &#x200b; here is the automatic feeder my pitching machine company makes but at $800 its well outside my price range [spinball feeder](https://ireddit/6npf7fga8ql31png) &#x200b; here is a makeshift feeder someone made (not sure what they used as the motor and not sure how it attaches to the machine) &#x200b; [makeshift](https://ireddit/i683fprv8ql31jpg) &#x200b; i was able to find two automatic feeders online from heater sports for only $60 which is certainly affordable and probably a better route than making my own feeder &#x200b; [heater sports automatic feeders](https://ireddit/enetgceq9ql31png) &#x200b; the two poles on the automatic feeder attaches to their two holes on their pitching machine as shown below &#x200b; [heater pitching machine](https://ireddit/4gaen5y2aql31png) &#x200b; but my pitching machine doesnt have two holes for their automatic feeder so now the million dollar question is **how do i attach their automatic feeder onto my pitching machine** &#x200b; (1) my ball chute (where baseballs go in - red arrow on the first picture and the two images below) is actually removable it has a bracket it attaches to my preference is to some how use heater sports feeder and using nuts/bolts and attaching it to my bracket of my pitching machine then i can easily use flexible tubing to connect the feeder to my ball chute but the hard part is how do i get nuts and bolts to attach to the automatic feeder and my pitching machine (2) probably the easiest method would be to attach the automatic feeder directly to my ball chute its made of hard plastic and should hold up the weight of the feeder and baseballs but i have no idea how id attach the automatic feeder to my ball chute (3) third method would be to some how get the automatic feeder on its separate tripod stand (similar to what spinballs automatic feeder is) then i could easily use flexible tubing to connect it to my pitching machine again the part that needs figuring out is how to attach the automatic feeder onto a tripod &#x200b; have basic typical tools most households have (drill screwdriver wrench etc) dont have access to or know how to weld &#x200b; &#x200b; [my insert ball chute ](https://ireddit/wnanqsbzbql31png) &#x200b; [my insert ball chute](https://ireddit/po7lycg1cql31png),0

2794,looking for cellar advice with mould issues (uk) hey weve a late 1800s end terrace with a cellar when we moved in (april this year) we got it tanked with membrane over walls and floor and plasterboard put up over the walls and boarding on the floor theres also an old victorian cold stone table which didnt get covered and is still in contact with the outside wall the steps down havent been covered either we then filled it with our extra stuff to be unpacked later after a few weeks we found significant dark patches of mould behind boxes and so scrubbed them with lots of anti-mould spray from b&q it was cold and 80% humidity so to reduce this weve purchased a small dehumidifier rated for a room of that size and had it running pretty much continuously for 3 months the humidity can get as low as 43% but if its off for a few days it rises up to 60-70% again since the first mass clean of mould in april/may we saw a few patches develop but we havent seen any mould in the past month or two but im a little worried about when it gets colder outside weve recently had radiators fitted to deal with the cold and they seem to be able to keep it at or above 21c though theyve only been needed the last 2 weeks do you think i should be concerned if so would covering the stone table/steps help or using anti-mould paint on the walls,0

2796,advice regarding shed renovation please ok when i moved in here 9 years ago i acquired a garden so bought myself a little shed for storage and give myself a crafting space whilst most of it has held up well the front and the roof has taken the brunt of the british weather so before winter sets in i want to do a little renovation work but ive not tackled a project like this before and funds are limited so before i go into this id like to pick your brains on this please the pitched roof that was supplied is made of chipboard and its not survived the rain especially as the asphalt that covered it has shrunk somehow exposing it i plan on replacing it with osb and replacing the rather lacklustre beam inside with something more substantial four rafters running down the length of the pitch two at each end and a couple in the middle i want to use birdmouth joints for this something ive not tried before i also want to increase the pitch of the roof slightly to aid run off in heavy weather can i do this by adjusting the birdmouth joints or do i need to adjust the height of the back and front wall of the shed the front would be easy as that is being replaced anyway if i only make the front taller though itll require adjusting the side walls and thats whole extra bucketful of work i hadnt planned on also happy to take on any other advice you may have thanks for reading and a preemptive thank you for your advice,0

2800,tried to clean mold off an interior granite wall now it smells awful anything i can do to fix this [help request] hi [uk btw] if this isnt the place for this then let me know and ill delete it im just somewhat desperate as my room/study in my house is somewhat uninhabitable now i have a granite wall in my house which has a mold problem on the inside its a feature granite section that i believe goes all the way to the outside which has been pebble dashed a mix of white and dark mold had grown across this wall and i attempted to clean it by painting on thick bleach waiting 2 hours then sponging off with water the bleach did foam a lot (like really a lot) and i dont know how successful i was in taking it off since doing this ive ventilated heavily for 2 days and run fans and dehumidifiers overnight the dehumidifier isnt picking up much water so i can only assume that the air isnt damp the issue is there is a very strong mold/damp smell in the room now which wasnt present before attempting to bleach the mold is there anything i can do here or a product i can apply to kill the mold/block this smell ive only been living there for a year and a half so im not sure what the previous tenants did to the wall before i moved in but another thought that occurred is that the granite might have been sealed or varnished in some way and my bleaching has removed this barrier allowing the damp wall smell to come into the room any help or advice on solutions/products would be much appreciated research online offers a million solutions to general mold issues from spraying vinegar to renting an industrial chemical fogger (i dont even know if i could get one where i am) but the mold is surely dead from the bleach so im not sure where the awful smell is coming from thanks rewan **edit** for info the current plan seems to be to attack the granite wall with a dedicated anti-mold spray then use a granite sealer to hopefully put a barrier between the room and any damp/mold im researching appropriate products at the moment,0

2892,"diy 21 stereo tactile transducer ""buttkickers"" tactile transducers if you are unfamiliar are basically subwoofers that shake the object they are attached to instead of moving air when attached to furniture you replace the bass sound with a (near) silent vibration i got a buttkicker gamer 2 late last year and while i love how i can feel explosions in movies or being shot at in games you always feel like you are in the middle of the action i started wondering if there was a way to improve the immersion it offered i wanted a better appreciation for off-screen explosions i wanted to be able to react to games when i was *almost* being shot what i was asking for was a stereo tactile experience as far as i can tell no one really makes this for consumers so i went to a few stores and ended up building a 21 tactile transducer experience you can watch my explanation and demo of it here: [https://youtube/8v\_42ygivyw](https://youtube/8v_42ygivyw) the wiring is simple: audio jack -> splitter -> to two rca cables -> two separate amps -> to speakerwire -> to transducers on my pc i have a sound card that allows me to plug the two transducers into a shared left and right channel and the buttkicker into my sub channel the video shows how i made it but it doesnt really do the experience justice also i built mine knowing i already have a buttkicker gamer to use as the ""01"" channel but had i not had one i could have left it out and the experience would still be quite immersive or i could have used a 3rd transducer for the dedicated sub channel i watched die hard with a vengeance and the intro was simply amazing when i play call of duty or overwatch i now feel the direction to run oh and i can turn off my subwoofer and use this to watch movies or play games *at any time of the day* because there is no bass in the house to bother anyone [testing a 20 tactile experience on my ipad](https://ireddit/9eo9pmojvdl31png) parts: 2 x aurasound ast-2b-4 pro bass shaker tactile transducer 2 x nobsound g2 subwoofer amplifier & mono power amp stereo speaker wire 35 mm to stereo rca mono splitter 2 x rca cable a wooden serving tray with curved handles plywood 8 screws with bolts and washers 15 inch thick foam felt fabric fabric adhesive spray hand saw",0

2897,"basement insulation questions hi all i live in nh and have some questions about basement insulation before we begin here are a few photos of the basement: as some additional background: the cement walls of the basement start about 2-3 feet above grade behind the gray plywood door are the stairs to the cellar doors (which are the standard metal cellar doors) theres no insulation on the plywoodtheres also no insulation between the basement and first floor i do need to keep the basement above freezing because thats where all the water stuff is and there is a heating element stretching about a quarter of a long wall and a thermostat for the basement im looking for suggestions for best bang-for-my-buck for insulation i am aware that nh has a program that will pay 1/2 the cost of any insulation upgrades done by a professional up to $4k after a $100 inspection but you need to have 12 months of utility bills (which i dont have yet) and there are certain requirements for the amount you have to spend to heat during the winter (im not sure what those are however) id rather not spend an excessive amount on heating this winter if there are a couple simple changes that i can make especially ones where it will end up being far cheaper to diy than hire a professional so there are a few areas that i was considering - 1 replace the plywood door with a normal insulated steel door i cant imagine that the plywood has any real r-value and a prehung steel door should be fairly easy to install not sure if this is worth the upgrade so i figured that id ask 2 replace/fill the empty rim joist spaces insulation its currently fiberglass ive heard that this is no longer recommended/not nearly as effecient as other methods however im not sure what method is best ive heard both: (a) cut foam board to fit and spray foam the gaps around the edge and (b) spray foam the rim joist the only issue i have with pure spray foam is that ive had to replace a couple areas where there were doors so i kinda want to keep those accessible if there are issues in the future ive also heard that i have to get the foil-backed foam board if i want to go that route suggestions the internet seems to have different opinions depending on the site im also not sure how much better that will be than it is currently 3 begin the process of insulating the walls via rigid foam i""m not sure on the best method on this or whether its really worth it i would imagine that it would be for the section above grade at least and id rather look at just doing the foam board rather than build a whole 2x4 wall but im open to suggestions 4 anything else i missed if im insulating the walls do i really need to be concerned about the spaces between the joists between the basement and the first floor i do currently seem to have quite a few spiders in the basement (yuck) and am hoping better sealing will eliminate that problem my last place had a red-squirrel and mouse problem (yuck-est) so im not eager to introduce any elements which would be attractive for rodents/would not be easy to remove and replace if necessary i havent seen a squirrel or mouse here yet thank god but definitely want to keep in mind their love of fiberglass and the need to exterminate any which do make it into the house",0

2919,"how to bring ethernet to a room across the hall in rented apartment i moved into a new rental the fiber optics outlet is in the middle of the living room right next to the swisscom dsl+phone plug but i need ethernet the most in the office across the hall wifi and powerline are not an option because theyre too unreliable and only provide a couple hundred megabits at best i cant drill or alter the walls in any way because theyre freshly painted and im not sure ill be able to patch them up and find matching color paint to complicate things they painted over wallpaper i guess to give the paint some kind of texture id rather avoid doing anything to the walls there are several panels in the ceiling which i assume are the points where electrical cables meet i havent opened these panels yet to look because theyve been painted shut and i dont want to open them and damage the paint if not necessary in the room that shares a wall with the office there is a plug labeled t+t which i assume is another swisscom plug on the wall in the hallway there is a t+t panel which im guessing is ""telegraph + telephone"" and which i suppose is the point where the swisscom cables come in from the outside ive thought of a few way i could bring ethernet to the room: 1 i could pull a 15 meters long fiber cable from the outlet to the office that would involve going around and across 4 doorways i might be able to tuck the fiber behind the baseboards (which are screwed on conveniently rather than nailed) but that still leaves me with several 90 degrees turns across the doorways which i dont think the fiber cable would take very well i also has to make it across a door and i suspect opening and closing a door over the fiber will eventually break it 2 i could somehow thread a fiber optics cable from the living room swisscom socket to the bedroom swisscom socket and then have the cable turn around the wall through a doorway to the office not a huge fan of this either because the cable would somehow have to make it across a door and i suspect the glass inside it might break from closing the door over it too much 3 fiber along the electrical lines there is power in every room and maybe fishing the cable through these wall plates all the way to a power outlet in the office would do the trick not sure how safe that is though because i know cables can act as wicks when there is a fire and spread the fire quicker 4 because im using a media converter anyway i could pass ethernet cable around instead of a fiber optics cable i want the router firewall etc to be in the office anyway so that could work i dont think passing it along the electrical wires would be safe but what about along the swisscom lines further questions i have are: - what really are these ceiling panels and that t+t panel - how hard or realistic is it to fish cables through existing conduits in the walls - if i cant fish cable through the walls what do you use to attach the cable along the walls without damaging the walls or baseboards when you remove it - is flat ethernet cable better or should i stick with round cable considering ill have corners to turn what i mean is there will be some turns that are 90 degrees along the same plane but there also will be turns that are 90 degrees across two planes: these are not a problem with round cables but they are with flat cable from what i can picture in my minds eye finally pictures:",0

2931,"suggestions for repairing old basement walls i recently purchased a 110 year old house with a limestone block foundation and i am looking to ""clean-up"" the basement as best i can one way that i hope to do that is by repairing and patching the basement walls it appears that the limestone block foundation was originally coated with a thick covering its much thicker than plaster and i believe the term is parging over time the coating has cracked in places and even detached from the wall fortunately the majority of the coating is still present and seems to be very durable (ie not brittle) that means that i would ideally be able to repair the affected areas rather than replace the entire coating as i have not done this type of repair work before i am wondering what the best approach would be in my own research i have come across numerous products ranging from drylock to quickrete has anyone worked with these types of old basements before pictures are linked below",0

3049,"we went the diy route with our new countertops and are super happy about it we are in the middle of a kitchen renovation right now and although (eventually) we hope to go with granite or quartz countertops we did not want to drop the ~$5000 for new countertops after the contractor discount i would be getting because of my work instead after lots of research into cheaper options (which there are frustratingly few of) we decided to chance a go with epoxy countertops we debated on doing laminate but i just hate the inorganic look of laminate and the edge options are not my favorite i very much dislike the 90 discolored edges of laminate ive done concrete countertops before which we loved but the style didnt quite fit our new kitchen we also have a lot of countertop space and concrete would be very cumbersome to attempt overall it didnt fit our situation the pros: -very inexpensive -""natural""ish looking (with some artistic talent) -more natural rounded edges -waterproof -heat proof -scratch resistantcan also be buffed out if needed -not ""plastic"" feeling like most laminate -more diy friendly than concrete -if you mess up you can just buy some more epoxy and try again over it -different finish options -warmer feeling than stone the cons: -pretty steep learning curve with making it look ""real"" -messy when youre pouring the epoxy -some woodworking skills and tools required -edges arent perfect and can easily be messed up -still not real stone the costs: -$80 for epoxy -$25 for colored powder/primer -$25 for two sheets of partical board -$10 for mixing buckets -$10 wood glue -some other small misc stuff i already had first i made the base by measuring the shape i needed and cutting it out on the two sheets of partical board i clamped the two sheets together and then glued it after it was cut but i might have switched the two in hindsight after it was all cut and the right size i took a random orbital sander and gently rounded the corners and edges gotta protect little baby heads next i covered our entire kitchen in plastic do not skip this step the epoxy gets everywhere as it needs to drop off the sides to cover the edges i brought the base back inside set it up on the plastic covered island and got the epoxy ready i wont go into detail with mixing and pouring the epoxy as countertop epoxys website and youtube channel goes into depth on everything i will say that the thing that i learned (at least in our case and with the look we were going for) less color is more we wanted mostly white counters so the more color we added the harder it was to get back to white if we used too much we found that if there was an area we didnt like we could take a paint roller and roll over the spot we didnt like and it would make it pretty much go away youve got like an hour of working time before the stuff wont self level anymore another thing we learned is do not skimp on epoxy if the directions say you need a gallon of epoxy use a gallon if you go too thin it will start drying and leave these ""fish eyes"" or divots in the surface again watch their videos online for more after waiting a few days for it to cure and harden i took 320 grit sandpaper and buffed the whole thing with a random orbital sander to give it a matte finish and take away the shiny plastic look that epoxy can have if left alone some people like that look but we dont honestly it makes it look like real stone when its matte as opposed to shiny anyway all in all were really happy with them its obviously not real stone but for less than $200 we can always go with real stone after we save and want to drop the money honestly though i think it looks a lot like real marble we spent a lot of time in stone warehouses and it definitely looks like some of the slabs we liked it looks even better in person thanks for sticking with me through this novel here are some pictures too:",0

3068,help with storm door installation posted same on homeimprovement i guess no one over there has any input :( so hoping you guys/girls might be able to help me out with this> album of whats here now: having watched a few videos but having never had to install one of these it looks like the outer casing as you can see in the pics is going to be an issue and may be the reason why the previous owner (bought house 1 yr ago) has the current style door in there current door is almost purely decorative - provides almost 0 protection against the elements if you see in the pic how the decorative casing/trim bows out at the bottom - i dont see how im going to be able to attach the frame/jamb to this in i think the 2nd pic you can see how they added a piece to the rough opening to be able to affix the hinges on the current door id be able to attach this side if it werent for the fact that i want this door to be hinged opposite to the current one - for the reason that the hardware for the interior entry door is almost guaranteed to conflict with the hardware for the planned storm door we rarely use the front door as we enter from the back where the garage is so the inconvenience of having the 2 doors hinged opposite isnt an issue edit - after looking at this another minute i think im going to have to add a piece to the one side similar to the one thats already there where the current hinges are attached i really dont want to do this will require the door be smaller and weaker am i not seeing this whole thing the right way tia for any help and ideas,0

3142,pvc pipe -- brittle will it survive this project i am thinking of using pvc pipe to construct something unusual and am wondering if it is worth the cost (\~$100) four 8 pillars of 2 inch pvc connected at the top using three-way pvc elbows then plywood on top of that why because in winter we have some large chunks of ice that slide off the roof right over our rear entry door so this would be to create a sort of protective overhead gizmo in case a chunk of ice (the size of a 50 lb sack of potatoes) came falling down to hit the protection instead of my head or shoulder do you think the gizmo would survive multiple hits during the winter or would the pvc shatter this would be in temperatures of even down to -20f or even -30f i dont want to pay $100 and my time constructing this if first time it shatters the past winter we wore our bicycle helmets but this winter coming up we have a new dog which likes to lie down right outside the door-- and it would be injured or killed by the falling ice blocks yikes so i am looking for a solution the section of roof above the area has a rubber membrane / rubber roof causing the ice to slide off from heat from the house (bungalow style house so there is no attic to insulate to make the roofing cold),0

3258,"shed is finally finished tldr: it only took 9 years &#x200b; https://ireddit/f1acbrmj2ik31jpg weve all had those projects that started out planned with excitement but over time become a running joke or constant reminder that you lack the resources skills or time needed to complete what once made you so passionate im telling you if i can finally complete the worst part of waking up on the weekend you can too it really doesnt matter how long it takes the feeling of completing a project after years of procrastination lack of time or even hard times is even more exhilarating than completing a project on time and under budget you can finish it october 2009 i purchased my first starter home in a new neighborhood under development while it was only studs i came by every day after work to check out the progress pick out colors decide on tile etc but most importantly plan landscaping which included my first shed on my own land i had printed out plans for a [kit from home depot](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/handy-home-products-phoenix-10-ft-x-8-ft-solar-shed-with-floor-kit-18160-3/100350467) that was half shed and half greenhouse but unfortunately the glass part was on the 8 foot side of a 8x10 floor kit where i wanted the glass on the 10 foot side of a slab the house was completed in december 2009 and i moved in in the months leading up to moving day i had redesigned the home depot shed to suite my needs but retain the same set of building instructions and materials just dimension changes for walls and trusses (and the addition of anchor bolts) i had everything i needed to start construction on my dream shed come spring then i met my wife in january it wasnt her fault my priorities changed i did manage to pour the slab in may of 2010 with the help of my future wife as a date sort-of thing pouring the slab was the hardest i had ever worked (im a computer guy im handy but still a computer guy) i ordered a palette of cement bags rebar 2 yards of red sand for leveling and timber for the forms a friend of mine showed up to help set up the forms and happened to have a laser leveler and had the amazing idea to raise the form to the level of the foundation of my house i highly recommend doing this every time ive gotten a little bit of flooding in the back yard im thankful he had that idea i rented an electric mixer that fit 2 bags of cement at a time and started pouring for years afterwords id pull out the shed plans about once a month make notations check prices make minor changes the slab ended up becoming a pedestal for our picnic table for cookouts i felt i didnt have the time money or skill set to complete the shed family just happens our resources were shifted to a wedding to car repairs to children it just happens and years flew by people would ask about the slab and id have to explain my idea for the shed sometimes pulling out all my plans and notes to show them again the excitement i knew id get to it eventually but again things happen and years flew by five years later: may 2015: i knew i had a work bonus coming up in june and as an added bonus the final house of our planned neighborhood was under construction i had made friends with the contractor at this point and got the ok to pick their scrap pile i was able to build the walls and roof trusses to my modified design flat on the floor of my garage for just the cost of a pack of exterior screws the plan was now to erect the skeleton of the shed and use the work bonus to complete it that weekend i was able to erect the walls and trusses with the help of my neighbor the next weekend i was able to add the plywood roof base and cement anchors i picked a stack of 1x4s for the trim but it would have to wait until i could purchase the shed paneling a week later i got my bonus and picked up a bunch of sheets of shed paneling roofing fabric shingles and roofing tacks i was able to mount the paneling the trim and the shingles that weekend also that weekend the ac coil in my house broke no more work bonus the only thing i could afford the next weekend was 1 gallon of white exterior paint to try and protect the skeleton of the shed because i had no idea when i would be able to continue the shed just sat like that with just the trim painted and half exposed for another 4 years every time id get another bonus or raise my savings or get a tax return or surprise payout from somewhere something bad would happen the same weekend im not exaggerating id save up the funds to finish the shed and boom car breaks down badly next time: my dog gets hit by a truck next time: wife trips over the three legged dog and breaks a front tooth in half next time: daughter totals the new car (all of these happened all at when i was planning to finish the shed all of which cost thousands of dollars) it became a running joke in my family ""do you think our house would ever burn down"" ""about the same time im ready to finish my shed"" my wife and i were literally scared to receive a lump of money because it always ended badly well i was able to eventually finish my shed heres how it happened june 2019: my office got a new contract for a large installation and the customers were really demanding they wanted all the work done in 30 days i rode with the sales team (i being lead engineer) to meet with the new customer on the 45 minute drive my boss asked about my shed i explained everything that was going wrong whenever i was ready to finish it and how it haunted my dreams he told me ""if you can get this done on time ill give you a bonus to finish your shed"" immediately i was petrified ""you cant do that"" i said ""something bad will happen"" he changed his tactic to ""alright ill buy everything you need to finish your shed if you can get this project done in 30 days"" alright that works we shook on it july 2019: work project done i knew a lot of the wood on the exposed side was rotten had the boss-man order me a lot of extra 2x4s to graft into good pieces and replace the rot along with this was all the pieces i needed to complete my shed this included [sheet plexi](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/lexan-thermoclear-48-in-x-96-in-x-1-4-in-clear-multiwall-polycarbonate-sheet-pctw4896-6mmcl/205202473) [foam strips](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/frost-king-e-o-1-1-4-in-x-7-16-in-x-10-ft-white-high-density-rubber-foam-weatherstrip-tape-r516wh/100119011) for supporting the plexi off the wood roof trusses [mounting bolts](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/2-in-fastener-for-16mm-thermoclear-multiwall-sheet-85190128/206935863) more 1x4 trim paint silicone calk acrylic calk wood filler [plexi sheet connectors](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/2-in-x-96-in-x-5-8-in-thermoclear-polycarbonate-multi-wall-h-channel-pctwh-16mm/205202545) flashing drip edge quarter round for window trim more shed paneling plywood (to build my own door) door hinges latches door handle simple vent covers and probably other stuff i cant remember right now completing this shed was always on my mind and every month id go asses the weather damage and keep a running list in my head of what i would need to complete it so when it was time to square up with my bosss offer i was ready a week later a flat bed showed up at my house with more than everything i needed i started by ripping away all the rotted wood and carefully grafting in good wood i painted the finished grafts to seal them from the elements with high quality exterior paint and primer august 2019: i cut the 4x8 plexi into 2 strips and used the connectors to assemble them into a 10x7 sheet that slid directly into place with the seams centered on the roof trusses i layd a bead of construction adhesive on the bottom inch of the sheet and bolted in the 3""x3"" drip edge at the bottom i sealed the edge with silicone calk with a left over strip of 2 wide plexi i cut and mounted a window on the far side opposite the door and trimmed it with quarter round (sealing it with silicone calk) a storm was coming so i quickly had to mount the side flashing/drip edge and seal it before the rain my shed was now covered the next weekend i fabricated a door i cut the plywood to shape and covered it with wood paneling adhered with construction adhesive i framed it with 1x4 trip and screwed it all together i painted the trim for protection until i could get to the main paint i mounted the door against 1""x1"" door jams that i nailed into place i attached the door hardware my shed was now totally sealed september 1st-3rd 2019: paint and vents done its still hard to believe its finished it took so much out of me for the past 9 years that i still wake up feeling like theres something im supposed to be planning but for the first time i can walk out back in with my coffee and realize i dont have anything to do (as far as the shed is concerned) sorry for the long post im just extremely overcome with the feeling of accomplishment we plan on starting plugs in the greenhouse this spring and transplanting them in our new garden

3268,need recommendation for hardware i am looking to make outdoor blinds to block wind and i could use some recommendations on hardware since i dont know what i need is called im struggling to find it (if it even exists) what i want to do is use sun shade fabric and attach rollers to each side every 6 inches or so these rollers would fit into a track on either side of the blinds that would keep them from moving in the wind im struggling to find the track and rollers i considered using t-channel (like what many 3d printers use) but i dont think it will slide well enough whatever i use needs to be relatively element proof (though there will be a roof above it but the sides will be exposed to any windblown rain pine needles etc) something that utilizes ball bearing wheels in a track would be pretty ideal though id need it to have some sort of base that i can sew to the fabric can anyone recommend any products that would fit the bill for this id love any links that you think may work since it will give me a good starting point a note on the posting rules: im **not** necessarily looking for a specific place to purchase a product im trying to find out what product would work for this specific purpose i hope that this is within the rules thanks,0

3305,best power tool to cut fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together hello im renovating a fiberglass waterfall fixture for a friend and would like to cut out a hole at the back of the fixture so i can access the pump and wiring more easily this would be about 8x8 inches once done i want to glue it back in to avoid water droplets leaking out im looking for recommendations on the best tool to cut the fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together for this particular case the cut-out section is thankfully not in the path of the flowing water but i suspect that it is close enough to the base where the water falls that some water may occasionally splash back over to this section im away from home and in another country so my choice of power tools are limited i have access to a drill gun (can borrow) and a angle grinder (can rent) would the angle grinder be the better choice if so what disc size and type should i look for &#x200b; if i may add another requirement/complication - is there a way to convert this cut-out into a door or make it easy to reopen in the future in case of repairs what would be the best way to go about this im imagining a tiny hinge at the back but cant think of how i would make the edges water proof if it helps the fiberglass structure is cylindrical in shape and stands at about 35 feet,0

3309,trying to fix doorbell so my doorbell stopped working and i checked all of the common culprits (to the best of my ability) and none of those seemed to be the issue i checked the cables coming from the transformer (by sticking multimeter probes into the wire nuts coming from the transformer) and got a reading that seemed to indicate the transformer was not the issue i checked the striker to see if it was stuck but no it was fine the doorbell itself is a very basic run of the mill plastic piece with a light up button however the button was no longer lighting up (which is why i initially thought transformer) and when i removed the doorbell and rubbed the cables together nothing happens also when i place the multimeter probes on the wires that were hooked to the doorbell i get an extremely faint reading (like 01)  is there anything i am overlooking is it possible that we hung a picture or something and damaged the wiring in the wall running from the doorbell to the transformer also is there any easy technique to checking and replacing the wires without having to tear into the wall/ceiling this doorbell is on the front door and the transformer is in the rear of the house by the water heater and furnace i live in a townhouse happy to provide any other info that might help determine the cause and best fix thanks for any guidance,0

3415,weber genesis propane grill repair - huge yellow flames got my hands on a used weber genesis e-330 (knobs on front) propane grill that is in fairly good shape but has some issues main issue is that instead of normal blue flames im getting huge massive yellow flames coming out ive cleaned out the burners and they appear to be in good shape tank itself is fine as it works normally on a different lp grill have tried resetting the built-in safety valve on the propane tank using methods found online played with the air shutters which did help adjust the intensity of the flames but even the best possible adjustment is still far from normal i looked up the serial # and it appears this was originally converted from a natural gas model so perhaps something wasnt done properly when it was converted at this point i am thinking either (a) something needs to be cleaned or adjusted that i havent thought of yet or (b) whoever did the conversion did a poor job and didnt do it properly any suggestions of what i can check out to figure out the issue my thought from here is possibly the manifold maybe they never changed it when they converted it or something is faulty with the existing one unfortunately i havent had any luck getting in touch with the prior owner if he was even the one who converted it in the first place if it matters im located in the us thanks,0

3430,eliminating pink mold once and for all hi all im a new homeowner and am dealing with a pink mold/mildew() problem in my bathrooms i think its in the water because its in my shower in the toilets and in the bathroom sinks i dont notice it in the kitchen sink so maybe its in the air and just likes humid/wet surfaces right now our only method of dealing with it is bleaching these surfaces every few weeks when it starts to come back otherwise as weve learned it starts to climb into our grout and its horribly painful to deal with obviously that is a huge pain in the ass to be doing constantly is there any options for me to permanently deal with this like installing a uv bulb somewhere far upstream on my water line or something my dad is visiting next weekend and wants to help us with the house and this sort of thing feels like something id struggle to do on my own so it would be great if he could help implement a solution i was considering also finding ways to test the water or air to see if i could find the source of it any and all comments will be greatly appreciated by this new homeowner thanks all for the help,0
3431,shared wall from hell - what to do hey guys a new neighbor moved in taking over from the quiet spinster who resided there for the last several years my new neighbor likes watching movies at times i can only characterize as holy s**t now im a light sleeper and losing my mind building is from the 30s or 40s i believe if that gives any insight into what sorts of materials were working with i asked the landlord to intervene or potentially spray some foam in the walls and he said theyre not paying for anything i dont have a ton of money to throw at this problem but i was thinking of laying some foam insulation (these: https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/207168829) over the wall and then making a shiplap out of reclaimed wood to go over it i would put some thin 1/2x2x8 runners along the studs the foam panels in between then the shiplap anchored to the runners does this seem like a sound plan any pitfalls i should avoid any alternate materials that would perform better that wont jack the budget up astronomically thanks in advance all help desperately needed sort of at my wits end update: spoke w/ neighbor again today decided that the first logical step is to float his tv from the wall we dont share a wall but given that the walls are probably damn near hollow its probably using them as a reverb chamber so were going to put a piece of rubber between the tv and the mounting bracket then some acoustic panels between the tv and the wall,0

3457,an attempt at diy mold removal leads to a stinkier houseuh oh i have an old (\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\~1600 sq feet mostly two story) located in new england the first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement the basement especially had this smell and im still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement there is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s pretty good in this basement was a giant moldy plywood diy shelf / wall personally i think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement i demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (saturday) then yesterday (sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask i sprayed a \~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well i did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement after my diy remediation in the evening i closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement we awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell luckily i suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway &#x200b; now our first floor really stinks though and im worried about the following: 1 ive spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house joists flooring etc will get moldy (though i think thats unlikelyhopefully) 2 that there is ***another*** source of mold which i cant find that i disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight)  any thoughts or tips would be appreciated basement background: most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls not too bad never gets too wet down there though can get humid the kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor the sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect since i cant see it im worried about whats going on below the vapor barrier thanks for any help after reading this long post,0

3519,ge led15et8g tube bulbs burning out ballasts i bought some led15et8g tube lights to put in the set of 2 metalux fluorescent fixtures i had in my garage (4 lamp per fixture) these lights are supposed to be able to retrofit into an existing fixture with a ballast no bypass needed after installing them the next morning they both died checked the switch and the ends they were wired to both getting 120v (ballast is rated from 120 to 277) just to check i bypassed the ballast on one and they turn on but are very dim im guessing this is why the ballast is required for them (ive seen other led tubes can have the ballast bypassed) i found another fixture i had a shop one that hangs off chains installed 2 of the bulbs and they came on less than 10 minutes later the ballast burned out on this one too what kind of fixtures should i be using on these lights can anyone link me to some i can order online or get at a hardware store i didnt expect these to be such a pain,0

3525,question about mwbc wiring from panel house built in 1994 i am finishing the basement and am roughing in the wiring i hired a licensed electrician to install a subpanel as my main panel is full i was planning on using the existing basement circuit from the main panel for one of the circuits but am confused because the wire is 14/3 from the panel based on my research it appears that this was going to be wired as a multi wire branch circuit set up ie shared neutrals for 2 circuits using a single 14/3 wire the issue i am having is after looking at the main panel i am not seeing any red wires anywhere near the applicable breaker and as i understand it to do an mwbc to code it has to be wired out of a double pole breaker what am i missing here for reference the subpanel is only for 4 simple circuits 1 20 amp bathroom circuit 2 bedroom circuits with one light and 6 receptacles each and one circuit for 4 led hall lights and 9 receptacles nothing complicated,0

3642,"there is a floor above my floor is this common hey everyone i am a first time homebuyer and admittedly i took on my first house which was most likely above my abilities but here i am trying to do and learn as much as i can &#x200b; 2 weekends ago i decided to tear up the old disgusting carpet the previous homeowner had and i was going to lay down some 12mm laminate plank i got 3 rows of the flooring installed before it because clear that it wasnt going to be possible on the warped flooring due to a lot of sag i thought it over for a couple weeks and then decided that i would take a trip into the crawlspace (previously unvisited due to not knowing where the entrance was) and take a look at the joist/subflooring state i figured i could jack it up install some support and it wouldnt be all that bad &#x200b; enter today i cut a small hole in my sons closet so that i could hopefully create a hatch and then properly fix it after after cutting the piece of plywood though i was met with another layer of flooring i then realized that there were no actual joists that i could see immediately but 2x4 framing after putting the pieces together i realized that the front entrance of my house has a weird 5"" or so step in a doorway that seems a few inches short it hit me that for some reason im assuming the condition of the true subfloor that at some point an owner installed a second floor system above the original &#x200b; is this common a lot of things in this house were obviously hacked together &#x200b; &#x200b; edit: \[pictures in link at bottom\] i really did not expect this much of a response holy crap but anyways: &#x200b; so i thought i would come back and update this i spent a lot of time thinking about this and then went to lowes the original picture is taken where i planned to put a hatch and is located in the bedroom closet on the (insert obvious joke here) floor but the flooring i am actually concerned with currently is in my dining room after i found this and read through a bunch of advice i decided that i would try to cut a bit out of the dining room subfloor and weigh the idea of just doing the second layer subfloor making it look good flooring it and pretending that it never was an issue until i got a chance to actually look under the house &#x200b; well this was not the case &#x200b; i made a small hole in the living room floor only to find the actual crawlspace i then realized that there was actually a 2x6 sitting on top of what i assume was the original joists raising my floor roughly 55 inches explaining the height difference between the bathroom and the front entrance ive decided to rip up all the subfloor and remove the 2x6s that raise my floor which should make sense of the entrance and bathroom and then tie new joists into the existing old ones for strength while also providing a new straight surface as well as adding additional supports (the current space between the joists 18"" apart was a 2x8 perpendicular at every 30""s im going to put them at probably every 15""s knowing that its likely overkill but safer than sorry) after all this im going to resheet it with plywood and then lay my laminate (vapor barrier included) &#x200b; more pictures in this link : dining room more floor in under my floor &#x200b; [floorception - a floor withing a floor](https://ireddit/z2zmp8an1tj31jpg)",0

3797,tight staircase - need some suggestions my basement stairs need a proper banister and balusters for safety and to meet building code (ontario) im having a hard time visualizing how these stairs will look when finished and google hasnt turned up good finished examples of people having done similar heres pictures of my stairs and pics from a neighbor with a similar layout (with banister added no balusters) my problem is that the stringer for the stairs is in line with the drywall on top i want a handrail that goes the full length of the stairs and balusters between the baluster tops wall and handrail im not sure how to make it fit newel post i can do easy handrail is harder **sweep handrail** \- i cannot find a picture of someone sweeping a handrail around a ceiling transition like that only a vertical wall transition the problem is that the handrail needs to sweep in about 4 steps before the side is closed off so id need to have 4 steps with balusters in the middle im wondering why i cant find a pic anywhere of anyone who has done this though everyone who puts a regular banisters over the stringer in these situations seems to end it at the ceiling and leave a big gap [example](http://macmillanandsoninccom/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1522236158-striped-stair-carpet1-960x1280jpg) **pigs ear handrail -** [example](https://wwwloveskirtingcouk/images/solid-walnut-pigs-ear-handrail-3-6-metre-p465-12747_imagejpg) i could put a pigs ear handrail directly over top the stringer i would cut a section a drywall out to recess the rail so that the outside of the stringer and the outside of the rail are aligned then i could use simple round tube spindles to baluster drilling proper holes into the bottom of the pigs ear might be challenging not sure how this will look in the end anyone have any other suggestions or ideas or other finished examples,0
3798,ill keep it simple im trying to put my kitchen back together and looking for advice on hiring a professional vs hiring a friend who does it professionally we just bought our first house we hated the shape of the kitchen (but loved everything else) and decided to change it we had a contractor help us take it all apart remove the cabinets put the stove and dishwasher where we want them and then he bailed we bought the unfinished cabinetry and i finished it all myself we are ready to put it all back together i found a friend who does this professionally and is willing to help us complete the diy for like $250 my fiancee seems to think we can hire a professional for around the same cost i know thats not possible ive gotten several quotes we cant afford the cost and i need help explaining to him the pros and cons of each so he can see that doing this my way is reasonable,0

3926,"need ideas and/or advice for a deck gate we have a second-floor condo that has a staircase leading to our back deck (and the one for the condo above us) and need to put in some form of gate were not allowed to alter the railing though so it limits our options the previous owner used a piece of lattice attached on one side with zip ties as hinges and then ""latched"" with a bungee cord the lattice ended up breaking when left open on a windy day which wasnt a terrible tragedy because it was cheap and getting very saggy anyway since then weve been using a baby gate connected on either side with bungee cords this was never intended to be a permanent solution though because its not secure annoying to put back in place (we exit via our back door 99% of the time) and now unsafe for our toddler since she can easily unlock the screen door to get outside and cant resist either rattling the gate or playing with the bungee cords and id like to replace it before she manages to knock it loose and fall down the stairs right now it feels like our best option is to just get a new piece of lattice and go back to the old way (except with a fastening solution other than a bungee cord since the kid is too smart for her own good and will defeat those soon) but im open to other ideas thanks tl;dr: i need a deck gate without any drilling or other rail-altering installation required",0

4075,rental: stacking things on gas oven hello ive recently moved into a 50s-era rental house that has limited kitchen space theres a little gas oven and a hob next to it it would be great to use the space on top of the oven for food prep or for my kettle/toaster but naturally it gets quite hot i was considering grabbing some fire-resistant board to pop on top so i can use it as another surface but im not sure if its safe or a great recipe for fire when ive been researching most of the guidance is for electric ovens or gas ovens that have a hob on top rather than the oven on its own some things ive read have discouraged it but usually due to ventilation concerns which is not a concern in this case because theres no ventilation on top tl;dr is putting a fire-resistant board on top of a gas oven and then leaving your electric kettle or toaster on top a recipe for fire thank you very much,0

4085,"tile project - discovered a triple layer of very thin backer-board under tile i just tore up the tile in my second floor bathroom and i only have experience doing tile work on my first floor and directly on the slab hopefully the link i attached is functional and you can visualize what i have going on with my second floor it appears that the previous owner secured some type of mulit-layer backer-board right over the existing linoleum flooring and then tiled over that im confused because there are three very thin layers of backer-board and when i pulled the tile i cleanly removed the top thin layer of backer-board im thinking that maybe i got lucky and can just tile over what is left on the floor (the 2 thin layers of backer-board) or im screwed and have to pull everything up and start from scratch ive never seen or used this very thin (each layer is \~3/32"") backer board so its throwing me off is it possible that the previous installer intentionally used this triple layer so that the next install would be quick and easy has anyone ever used or seen this technique before any help would be appreciated thanks edit: after some research i have learned that the ""multi-layer"" underlayment that i am seeing is a result of the 1/4 hardibacker ""delaminating"" apparently older versions of hardi are laminated plan is to demo everything down to the subfloor and put down new 1/4"" hardi [https:\/\/drivegooglecom\/drive\/folders\/1gqmkhthimhqxsopmtthhadgktuzkuvc\_usp=sharing](https://ireddit/893adaoqavi31jpg)",0

4116,rehabbed master bath that was in dire need of a facelift let me preface by saying i have very little experience with any kind of rehab but i have been reading this sub for several months so between this and many dozens of hours of youtube how-to videos my confidence level was just enough to begin demoing something i decided my drab master bath would be my first project i mean how hard could it be right i apologize for the sporadic photos as it wasnt my original intention to document the remodel but at some point i figured it would be good to get opinions from this knowledgeable community i didnt do anything that might be considered overly difficult i did find some bonus space behind the prefab shower so i tiled it in and made a larger shower with a bench the only thing i didnt do myself was a bit of plumbing- had to have the shower valve changed out (wasnt aware of this until after shower was tiled so had to cut access hole from back side) and also had the plumber hook up the sink which required a fair amount of cutting to the back of the vanity total cost was in the $3k-$3500 range i suspect this is considerably cheaper than a contractor would have charged though i didnt get any quotes entire project took 9 or 10 weeks of part-time work but i was in no rush biggest surprise was cost and meticulousness of waterproofing the shower alcove hope you all dont slay me too badly bathroom renovation,0
4117,is it possible to operate a bank of led ceiling lights that is controlled from 3 locations with a dimmer switch we recently had our kitchen remodeled (not diy) and part of that process was installing a bank of 7 led ceiling lights they are slimline canless led lights that are 15w / 120v / 60hz and claim to be dimmable in the product listing and in all the included documentation (not including a link to the exact product because i think that may be against the rules) all the lights are controlled as a group and cannot be turned on or off individually there are 3 different switches that can turn these lights on and off and they are wired correctly where each switch will turn the lights to the opposite state of what they currently are the electrician was originally going to install a dimmer switch but didnt for some reason i wasnt around when this happened so wasnt able to ask him why and i have no direct way to contact him as he was a subcontractor are the lights actually dimmable with this setup i have a limited understanding of all this stuff but ive swapped out a few light switches and wall plugs when necessary i feel comfortable enough doing that but i just have no idea what i need to actually accomplish this i only need to be able to dim the lights from one of the switches even though the lights can be controlled from 3 different switches we rarely use 2 of them im not looking for an exact product recommendation but i just need to know what terms and specifications i should look for when selecting a dimmer switch to accomplish my goal from the research ive done im guessing i just need a single 3-way switch that is capable of handling at least 105w (i would also like to get a smart switch if possible assuming there is one available that fits my needs),0

4273,[need advice] thoughts on how to remove the rest of this elastomeric paint from a flat roof &#x200b; i applied this elastomeric paint (several coats) to a flat roof about 6 years ago water ended up ponding on it and it ended up peeling up to what it looks like now i should have leveled it or used a different coating underneath is a rubberized roof i believe &#x200b; removing this by hand and scraper will probably take forever but is probably the safest way without damaging the rubber i was thinking about renting or buying a pressure washer and using a minimal setting to remove it all my last resort is manually with a scraper and maybe a stiff bristle broom after i remove it i plan on using bitumen or one of the silver paints that can withstand some ponding thoughts on removal edit: barely step on it need to gently shovel in the winter though when we get abnormal amounts of snow sometimes we would like to sit out there once and a while though,0

4557,flat roof insulation bridge (advice) so i live in new orleans its hot and humid af the previous owners built a stupid flat roof and out an a/c pipe (black steel) about 1/4 from the underside of the roof its running pretty cool like 48 degrees and the space is 100+degrees this time of year so science occurs and the pipe sweats i found this out when the ceiling above my bed collapsed so i cut the ceiling out and checked the pipe its dripping with sweat the wrap is all cracked and worthless head pressure was good freon is good even better when i gave it a good cleaning but it all really comes down to the amount of radiation that pipe is getting its just science it mechanics so my options are to either get a bigger unit and the design the system or attempt to shield and insulate that pipe there is no room above it to put anything meaningful in so im going to start but building an insulation bridge for the area over the pipe a ventilated shield as well as re-wrapping the thing (no small task as the pipe runs through two rooms only one under the flat roof) if that doesnt work im going to build a sloped aluminum drain channel out to a drain pipe and say screw it anyone ever deal with this kind of thing i cant find much in the realm of flat roof insulation bridges any advice will be courted if that doesnt work ill,0

4602,hanging things on old plaster walls (or drywall) hello--hoping to get some definitive answers to my ongoing wall saga ive been in my rental for about 7 years now and have tried and failed multiple times throughout the years to get things hung on the walls i never put much thought into this and just assumed my walls were made of drywall but i recently came to the realization that i may have plaster walls due to the following: * old nyc apartment built in 1910--based on my own sleuthing of property records i dont think the units were ever converted/resized so i believe the walls are original * past efforts to get screws into walls ended up in a crumbly mess and/or screws just spinning in place; holes usually end up bigger than the screws ive tried regular screws and those plastic anchor ones and unless theres a stud neither holds ive tried sticking in a thumbtack before--the wall is definitely too hard to do that by hand alone * walls are uneven and bumpy/lumpy (though this could also just be layers of layers of paint throughout the decades) and theres a small thin crack in one spot (again could just be cracked paint) * anyone remember making those rain sticks in grade school where you put rice in the tube to make the sound if i bang on the wall really hard thats kind of what it sounds like back there i think its old crumbly plaster loosening and falling * my walls dont sound super hollow though there is some hollowness when tapped i can hear neighbors muffled conversation vs being able to make out word for word based on the description above can anyone confirm this sounds like plaster rather than any other material then knowing that my walls are plaster and not in the best shape is there still hope for me to hang things i live in a studio with super high ceilings so id like to be able to maximize storage specifically by adding more shelves and possibly mounting the tv screen so i think max weight would be about 50-75 lbs are toggle bolts perhaps the answer thanks in advance,0

4653,how do i splice beams for a deck diagram included heya while away for work a contractor came in and poured some footings for a deck foundation instead of pouring them 8 apart or less they range from less than 8 to greater than 9 apart this means that instead of my 3-ply 2x8 beam having offset 16 boards spanning the 32 length of the deck i now have to splice beams in odd locations i dont know much about this at all if it helps the deck is only 1 to 2 off the ground max (sloped yard) [in this diagram i have 3 options ive come up * a - i splice every single beam segment over a post this seems the most stable against shear force but i have read in a few places online that this isnt ideal because youve got lateral weakness since the splice is through every board * b - i vary where my splices are the middle segment of beam splices over posts the sides splice over the span but are offset i dont like the idea of having a splice mid-span * c - inner section spans two posts splice is in the last quarter of the middle span outer sections splice over posts im leaning toward this but open to other suggestions in the diagram i try to show the layering of the beam such that the middle segment would be in the middle of the 3-ply beam when i look this up online i get multiple answers and i cant seem to find anything concrete i see diy videos on youtube of people splicing beams any which way and on other sites i see warnings never to splice anywhere except over a beam still other sites say not to splice all boards in a beam over a post then ill find some other site that says you *can* splice off a beam im confused - and ive never built something like this before this would be so much easier if the footings were in the right place but here i am any advice is greatly appreciated,0

4665,"reclaimed barnwood table refinish: best approach for filling cracks holes and seams in tabletop [i picked up a reclaimed barn wood that i am in the process of refinishing ive sanded it down and i am preparing to do some repair prior to staining the top a dark color (either walnut or espresso) i love the character of the dings holes and seams in the wood however i have young children who will be eating off this table and who i know will relish shoving food down into any cracks so this table needs to be hygiene-proofed [there are a couple of damaged areas](https://iimgurcom/tlsrxfcjpg) where i will replace boards however there are still a lot of old nail holes seams between boards and general ""character"" just begging to be filled with applesauce and macncheese im considering a couple of approaches to filling all these so that it the table is easy to clean and i was hoping to get some guidance on which is the best: - the first approach is to simply use a stainable wood filler and then stain and put a polyurethane coating on top it looks like this table was originally made this way [as i can see some sort of old filler in some seams](https://iimgurcom/dqldmvtjpg) if this is the best route can you recommend a product its been a few years since i used a stainable wood filler but it didnt look *great* when i used it the filler absorbed the stain differently from the wood and looked very artificial i am particularly concerned about the appearance of the seams if i go this route - the second approach would be to seal the holes from the bottom of the tabletop maybe use some wood filler here and there and then to epoxy the table top my thoughts are that the clear epoxy would settle into the seams and holes allowing us to see that texture but be sealed off from the gross kids my concern here is that it will look to ""plastic"" thoughts alternative approaches thanks in advance",0

4770,switch(es) blowing afci breaker [bathroom so i need some help (again) with an electrical issue i wired the basement and due to some new building code all the breakers are afci (which i am suspecting is a part of the problem) in the bathroom there 3 light switches labeled 12 & 3 on image switch 1 directs to a pot light and an led light switch 2 goes to a vanity light and 3 is a fan for months we havent been able to use switch 1 because it will trip the breaker not always immediately but usually within 30 seconds i spent all week trying to solve it i went into the device box and cleaned up the wires for the switches as best i could making sure nothing was exposed i replaced the switch (from another one in the basement so i knew it worked) this all improved the issue slightly in that it took a while longer to trip we kept thinking we had solved it and then short time later it would trip again here is where it gets weird we discovered an almost surefire way to make it trip was to have both light switches on (1 & 2) and then turn off switch 2 (ie the one that hasnt been a problem); switch 2 being turned off would kill the breaker as long as switch 1 was on i pulled out all the lights tested different combination of wiring such as one light being bypassed or cut off and this more or less holds true except now i find it takes the light a few minutes to heat up or whatever before turning off 2 while 1 is on will trip the breaker anyways there is not a lot of load on the circuit a tv and small deepfreeze and two lights that are rarely on (pantry) also i could just swap out the afci break for a regular since the inspector has come and gone,0

4844,some outlets/lights on circuit not functioning after replacing outlets finally got around to replacing the 6 outlets in my final two bedrooms today and ran into some issues (prior to this had done all other outlets on this level with no issue over the last few months) so i replaced the outlets and went to turn the breaker back on was greeted by an immediate short and the breaker tripping went back up double checked that i hadnt left any loose wires on the new outlets and tried a few more times each time with the same result finally a friend mentioned that i might be getting a 240v short if i hadnt removed the bridging tab (this house has a mixture of [2 and [4 outlet wiring this sounded promising so i went and snapped all the tabs off on the 4 wire outlets and was able to turn the breaker back on this particular breaker has the garage the bedrooms (outlets and lights) and a couple outlets from the basement on it (its a tuck under style garage so the bedrooms are right over the garage) the garage door opener powered on and our internet was working (the cable connection uses one of the outlets in those back bedrooms) so i assumed everything was working and went to run a couple more errands however got back home and realized that those two things (the one outlet and the garage door opener) were the *only* functioning things on that circuit double checked all other breakers and everything looks good about ready to try and get an electrician out here but figured id post here first in case theres some simple fix like there was for my first dumb mistake thanks edit: been doing more research online read that it could be a tripped gcfi there is a single gcfi outlet in the garage but that appears to have no power to it checked all other gcfis in the house and they all appeared correct edit 2: went and checked all the _old_ outlets (had to dig them out of the trash which was gross) and they all seem to have actually had the tab soooo now im confused final edit: well i replaced all the outlets with more new ones this time keeping the tabs on flipped the breaker and everything works so i guess the world will never know but im glad to have power to everything again,0

5056,releasing a 2 part plaster mold im sure the answer to this is out there somewhere but i cant seem to find it im making a 2 piece mold to cast wolf wax (machine wax) positives for casting in 1 piece investment powder molds via a burnout i have a bag of plaster of paris that im attempting to use to make a master with to save myself 50$ investment powder isnt cheap this isnt by first time making molds of various materials and im familiar with all but one problem here what im about to describe is by no means the proper way to do this with plaster so input there is also appreciated if there is an easier or more correct way ive done some small scale tests with a section of cured plaster i applied an oil that i felt was of the right consistency not to absorb too deeply (vegetable oil) to the mating surface i then poured freshly mixed plaster onto it ive done this before without oil and noticed that plaster tends to naturally seperate along a line where 2 different batches were poured after the first was cured in this test they did seperate as such but a couple pieces seemed to push the oil out of the way (along the edges and directly in the center where it was poured) and these areas bit hard enough to worry me on a large scale (2 sq/ft) mold even if small areas bite on that size of mold this can quickly become a problem is there something that works better to allow them to release while not soaking into the poures is this completely wrong and i should be using another method entirely to be clear im not casting with a metal positive and my problem isnt getting the master pattern to release from the plaster its in getting the plaster halves to release from themselves after pouring the second half i have used some other materials such as corn starch and even mold release which i typically use in my silicone 2 part molds to the same effect maybe its my coverage and im missing spots or maybe the lils are beading up during the few minutes where im mixing i dont know what the heck is everyone doing to get 2 halves of plaster to seperate,0

5108,is sealing and insulating basement sills a good idea i have an unfinished basement with open joists and sills there are definitely drafts of air coming in around the edge where the joists rest on the top of the foundation i am thinking of sealing in between the joists by filling the space between joists with fibreglass insulation batting then foam board sealed with expanding foam that will prevent any air flow into the basement and insulate from the outside wall above the sills however there are two concerns i have: 1) do i also need to seal around the outside edge with caulking or expanding foam where the outside wall meets the foundation otherwise im wondering if i will be forcing outside air up inside the wall or at least in the space between the outside wall and foam board 2) the drafty basement was being ventilated by that small amount of airflow will it create knock-on affects because of reduced or no air exchange now like mustiness or dampness do modern airtight basements require ventilation if anyone can offer any advice id really appreciate it,0

5227,first time buyer house has an old window resized with plasterboard how can i fix it **background:** me and my fiance bought a house last year and we have since renovated two bedrooms the lounge and the garden it was well looked after by the previous owner but very dated as she had owned it since the 70s and had used wood chip wallpaper to hide numerous sins fortunately ive been able to fix it to a standard we are happy with but i am now starting on the kitchen **problem:** unfortunately the [dining area window](https://iimgurcom/ylskhiwjpg) was made smaller when an extension was built onto the back of the house and the plasterboard () used to resize it is [significantly thicker than the rest of the wall](https://iimgurcom/uy7kkg6jpg) is there anyway to fix this without removing the material and starting over im not sure what the best way to tackle it would be **unsuccessful attempt:** out of sheer optimism [i used an electric plane on a small area](https://iimgurcom/qt1ihqbjpg) but it wont cut deep enough and it created a significant amount of dust and im not entirely convinced shaving the plaster down is the right solution **context:** the house is in the uk was built in the 50s all the walls are built from brick (even the internal walls) this is the only patch of plasterboard/mystery material that needs fixing any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,0

5246,transforming carpet stairs to wood for under $100 re-posted since original post was deleted for not having enough info redditors please let me know if the information below is enough for someone to perform the same project if not let me know what information do you want to know i felt like admin wrongfully deleted my original post our stairs were carpet and it was so ugly we had to do something about it we decided to make it a diy project after seeing so many people having success transforming their carpet stairs to wood saturday we had to pull up the carpet tools required utility knife and gloves after we pulled out the carpets there were thousands of stables stuck to the wood and carpet glues or whatever those white stuff are sunday-thursday next step is using a plier and hand pull the staples it was so many i almost gave up but i decided to pull some everyday after work then we used a $5 plastic wood filler from hd to fill up all the major holes that were on the wood friday-saturday next we borrow a sanding machine from a friend and bought a large pack of sanding on amazon for $12 we taped a plastic sheet at the top of the stair and at the bottom of the stairs while we sand to minimize the particles from going everywhere in the house probably only stopped like 60% sanding took a lot longer than we exepcted 2 full days of work to sand the steps and the railing so it can be stained also sunday-monday after we finished sanding we used an $8 wood stain i believe the color is kona first time staining wood i did not wipe it quickly enough so the color appeared much darker almost black on pictures we stained every other step so we can still get upstairs to our bedroom tuesday-thursday we applied a $20 floor finisher (semi-gloss) on the wood same step as staining we applied every other steps friday for the backboard we bought 2 of the 48x96 in beadboard white true bead panel from hd for $40 we cut it up to size with a table saw and used liquid nails to attach it to the backboard the whole project spanned over 3 weeks and probably spent about 45-50 hours to finish the color was darker than expected but it looks nice with the white backboard,0

5323,"hoping for some information on what i can and cannot expect from bondo tl;dr - if i were to try to make something like the green calf-plates on [these awesome spur-pads](https://wwwsherrilltreecom/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/241x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/1/41150-gecko-steel-climbers-webjpg) would a fiberglass product like bondo be a worthwhile approach or would it just shatter / crack-up the first time it was used id be using reinforcements inside the layers of fiberglass but unsure if its an ok material to use at all here am guessing the product shown uses a plastic ~~~~~~~~ i love diy and make my own stuff whenever i can sadly this (fiberglass resins) is an area im woefully unfamiliar with im skilled with fast-setting stuff like bondo like i can use 5min drywall spackle w/o issue fast-dry cement-based products have just never used this stuff so while i expect it *could* work i think my biggest uncertainty is just how fragile the stuff is going to be when making something thats subjected to minor pressures and is relatively-speaking a very skinny casting/form (those pad-shells i want to make so my diy spurs padding isnt just lashed in-place with nylon webbing lol are going to be like 1/2"" thick but an ~8""x12"" footprint) of course ill be using some form of skeleton inside it i didnt realize i omitted fiberglass sheeting til i got home but have to expect that the flexible-yet-resilient fabric i have thats used in the same manner only for roofing-tars that thatll be suitable here - im also picturing rebar (read: bicycle spokes that ill just cut-to-size with the angle-grinder) used both throughout the body as well as ""a border""/around the entire perimeter of such a project - is this type of approach going to be something thats more or less likely to work thanks a ton for any&all help/advice i love the idea of being able to use forms to make things with something besides cement/mortars because of their inherent limitations ive got a good feeling this is the right path for say making a custom outer-shell for a chainsaw or things like that but ive never worked with it or seen it worked with so hoping for thoughts on whether my expectations for it are wayyy too high or not lol :d again thank you for any answers/suggestions/tips etc they are greatly appreciated [ps- i just wanna be super clear about the spur-padding project this is not going to risk my spurs grip if the thing failed as its only function would be to contour my rubber padding to my leg id still have my same 1"" nylon webbing going around the spurs upper-metal rod so this is really just aesthetics but since my calf will be bumping it id hate to waste teh time just to find theyre full of cracks after the first use - *if* thats the case/expectation any suggestions on what else to do / use would be greatly appreciated for instance i know that some of these pad shells are made of carbon fiber and so far as i understand it thats basically the same as bondo+fiberglass sheeting (only its stronger because the carbon-fiber sheeting is stronger - though im clueless whether its 50% or 5000% stronger]",0

5330,"best way to enlarge a hole from 125""-15"" or larger im a gardener and as part of that hobby i have rain barrels i got these particular rain barrels from our local environmental action council & some from craigslist which look like the original owners obtained from the same council the problem i am having is that the plumbing fixtures that were added were siliconed on and not super well so i have been replacing them with bulkhead fittings with hose threading--the spigots/taps worked out great but the overflows are still not large enough this means that i cant daisy chain the barrels together currently initially i expanded the holes from 3/4"" to 1-1/4"" using a step drill for the the current overflows id like to expand the overflows to 1-1/2"" or potentially larger but i cant seem to find the right way or tool to do this i cant seem to find a step drill over 1-3/8"" where my current one maxes out and i cant use the oops arbors i have seen because the arbor on those is circular whereas my holesaw kit has a sort of square off circular arbor im considering using my step drill to max the holes out to 1-3/8"" and then using either my dremel tool or a file/rasp to expand it that last 1/8"" how viable a solution is this should i try something else edit: thank you all for your kind suggestions i decided to go with the step drill & file combo i planned on with u/misterhiggins confirming it was a viable option it took longer than i thought but not very long the hole isnt quite perfect but since this was for the gasket that the hose goes into its perfect enough id recommend anyone interested in purchasing a holesaw kit to first consider buying a spade bit/paddle bit instead also get a kit with circular arbors so you can use oops arbors or you know just drill the right size hole or dont try to retrofit something with the wrong size hole",0

5516,help request: swingset revival i never considered myself to be handy but my confidence has been growing since i became a home owner a few years ago however my latest project seems to go wrong at every turn despite it seeming very easy we have had a playset for the last two years however it is already starting to show some wear and i wanted to get out in front of things so that it stayed looking like new first i powerwashed because i had some mold/mildew stains i tried to be careful and not get too close or stay on one section for too long however despite my best efforts i fear that i did some damage to the wood then i tried using a deck/wood cleaner saw more success but still had some blotchy areas i tested out a semi-transparent stain/sealant but after one coat i already think i need something that does not show the wood grain (for reference in the imgur link the bench has one coat of stain) normally i would keep plugging away but i fear continuing this path and doing irreparable damage to a relatively new swingset does anybody have any advice when it comes to these projects do i have to sand (and to what effect) before staining if the wood seems to be in good shape any specific types to use imgur gallery:,0

5676,suggestions please !  so my father-in-law is getting married to a wonderful woman on nov 9th and i would like to make them something to celebrate their marriage as they are just doing a super simple court house wedding with no family unfortunately as they live in alaska and none of us could afford to make it on such short notice (it was a whirlwind romance) so i want to send them something special my craft strengths are wreaths crocheting lip balms/creams/salves the only problem is as they live in alaska anything i ship will have to be fairly small and light because shipping to alaska from here (from anywhere really) is hella expensive i also want to especially make his fiance feel welcome she doesnt have much family of her own no children and has been lonely for quite some time so i want her to know that she has family now and that were here for her/them so if anyone has any ideas of something special i can make them i would love the input !  i also dont mind experimenting with something new so bring on all the ideas !  thanks ! ,1

5985,making a simple leather cuff im no craftsman but i have gone to a local crafts place (dont know what to call it in english) and gotten a bit of help with making a pair of sweaters and fingerless gloves now i kind of want to experiment with making a wrist cuff the place has strips of leather and an old sewing machine meant for leather so i do have the objects needed im just wondering what to do about pattern and what kind of fastener to go with im not skilled enough to do anything truly elaborate yet but i would appreciate suggestions for something cool that a newbie can manage and then theres the fastener issue do you think a simple little bit of strip of leather attached a little inwards from each end for tying together would do it ? ,1
5986,a [quite possibly] strange request hello !  someone on r/reddeadredemption pointed me in this direction to look for answers and/or help so heres the story; a couple weeks ago my mum started talking about my cat needing a hat normally this sort of thing trails off but it hasnt this time i know shes been super stressed with a lot of not nice things going on in our lives so i thought that maybe this would give her a little respite of happiness so i decided to endeavour to get my cat a hat that being said i am incredibly shallow and selfish and decided that if i was going to sink any money into a hat for a cat that hates literally everything that i would seek out a hat that would also give me a little bit of happiness that hat just so happens to be arthur morgans hat from red dead redemption 2 so the strange request im bringing forth is this: does anyone know of anyone or any place that might be able to indulge me in this ?  maybe an etsy store that doesnt show up in my cursory search or someone on instagram that i wouldnt think of or even someone here that might be interested in the endeavour ?  i would truly appreciate any help you might have to offer xx,1

5988,need advice for pendant sealing hello everyone im new to this subreddit but i figured this would be a good place to ask - ive been working on making pendants out of rocks i find at my local rivers and painting on them and ive been looking for a good way to seal them so that they have a glossy finish and will be less likely to break if dropped at first i covered it with epoxy resin which smooths itself out and has an even finish while adding a layer of protection but that is difficult to apply tends to have noticeable bubbles and doesnt dry entirely clear (has a yellow-ish tint) i then tried a krylon clear spray-on paint thing and that also gave a nice gloss and even finish but doesnt dry very well and gets scratches in it extremely easy so i then tried a clear enamel acrylic paint but you need a paintbrush to apply it which means you can see the paintbrush strokes so its not smooth at all and also tends to get scratched (despite the internets claims that it was scratch resistant :/) so i wanted to know if anyone had advice for some other substance i could use or if theres a different way i could use any of the methods i listed above ?  thank you so much ! ,1

(it doesnt have to be the original pieces of paper since some are big with few words on it taking up more space) he also wrote me a poem a while ago and i want to frame that too so maybe two frames in a letter format is too much plainness ?  im having trouble figuring out how to display and frame them since im not a creative person and i thought someone from this subreddit could help me sorry if this type of thing doesnt belong here (im new) ! ,1

6552,advice on schoolwide outdoor fabric bunting project (teachers please help too !  ! ) i am on my daughters school pta and as part of our summer fair and event decoration we have strings of fabric bunting which is strung up outside last summer fair i noticed that the bunting was falling apart and as some of it is 13 years old i volunteered to organise a schoolwide project to create new bunting here are the finer details : 1) we are in the uk and the school is underfunded so all supplies have to be paid for out of the pta savings 2) the children are aged 2 - 7 (nursery to year 2) 3) there are 4 year groups (nursery (4 classes) reception y1 & y2) and aside from nursery each year group has 3 separate classes with roughly 30 students per class 4) the plan was to make 2-3 big banners plus enough bunting to go around the perimeter of the school (i still need to measure that) and so it would be preferable for each of the year groups (aside from nursery) to create a banner and each child (including nursery) will decorate a triangle 5) i offered to sew the bunting to the string if need be but i plan to get precut triangles and string/bias tape ?  ?  i dont mind ironing each triangle to set any fabric decor 6) we are in england and it rains a lot the bunting has to withstand rain and wind but will only be used a few weeks per year but i want this bunting to last it would also be helpful if it doesnt take too long to dry after rainfall heres what i need help with : 1) whats the best fabric to use for this ?  was thinking burlap/hessian but worried it would be hard to decorate i am not prepared to hem each triangle 2) what is the best medium to apply to the triangles that would be weather proof ?  im thinking markers paint fabric glue ?  ?  ?  i originally thought to steer away from sticking bits on as the old bunting is shedding sequins and felt all over the place 3) i was hoping to colour code the string somehow so we can easily tell which length of bunting fits on each section of fence but should each class have a different colour scheme or theme ?  i want the bunting to look nice and coordinated (and kid created) 4) whats a reasonable amount of decorating medium (paint /markers) per class ?  i can get sets of paint but i dont know how many each class would need also was thinking sets with mainly primary colours are cheaper but that will be glaring bunting whats the likelihood kids will mix to make another range of colours ?  5) am i over thinking this ?  is there an easier way ? ,1

6592,how to build a moving and height adjustable computer desk hello i am looking to build a computer desk that: * is height adjustable so i can lower and raise it according to my needs * has tires so i can move the desk easily from one room to another * has a monitor mounting arm or at least supports the weight of an external monitor i have a curved 24 inch external monitor that i want to mount i prefer mounting on an arm instead of just putting it on the desk because mounting makes the monitor sturdier and wont wobble or move a lot when the desk itself is moved * has some nice tubings for cable management i just want you guys to point me in the right direction i have never done any diy work in my life so i am inexperienced but i am willing to follow a tutorial or a guide or look at a blueprint and take my time working on the project i am not in a hurry even if it takes more than a month thanks in advance,1

6632,mindless crafts for the office ?  hi guys !  my job requires me to be on the phone a lot lately ive been having trouble staying focused and tend to drift to other things while im on the phone that pulls me off track so in an effort to keep myself engaged i started making paper clips chains which has helps a lot but i realized i could be actually making something rather than mindlessly putting a chain together & taking it apart &#x200b; so my question is what is something about as easy as a paperclip chain (i dont want to have to hunt for the next thing i need) but that i can make & keep ? ,1

6635,type of yarn/tips for crocheting safe cat toys ?  hello !  first of all first post on reddit at least on this account (i dont have almost any access to the email for the old one) secondlyive started to learn to crochet and im thinking of making some nice cat toys for my three cats ive noticed one of them loves playing with and chewing on string i dont know if i can give him that perfectly though im trying to get him some rope-based toys (we got him one recently and i immediately accidentally broke it) but i could at least crochet like- thin little tube things with texture or toys to attach to a cord plus a few cute little animal-shaped ones or whatever which at least he and the babiest cat both like playing with (i think queen lady-of-the-house cat just does most of her playing when we arent looking) **the question is:** are cat toys made from natural yarns (probably cotton or hemp or bamboo my mom is allergic to wool so im not just going to leave wool cat toys around the house for her) ever safe ?  im thinking about how they can be bitten apart and swallowed or come undone- the good news is im good at making nice tight stiff stitches are yarns with any % synthetic content safe/in any way sub-optimal for them ?  are any actually better ?  do you know of any dyes i should look out for and/or any brands that avoid dyes that might be harmful ?  im gonna try to support my local knitting shop so i want to try to buy within their stock and havent checked it out yet but also want to know if there are any known health hazards or other rules/tips learned about making cat toys actually come to think of it what about safe stuffing ?  i might experiment with crinkly paper and might make a few unstuffed tubes but little conventionally stuffed amigurumi toys would be neat too please know you dont gotta answer all of these questions to reply im just putting all of my thoughts out there and any nugget of insight is appreciated,1

6842,question about affixing pressed flowers to a glass frame hi !  its my first time here so i hope this is alright to post im in the process of setting some flowers that i pressed in a clear double sided frame like [this](https://ipinimgcom/originals/50/65/76/5065766ede930d89c714cf91e25356c2jpg) these flowers were pressed from a special occasion so i cant afford to mess it up !  i put them in place and closed the frame but unfortunately theres too much space between the two panes of glass so they arent pinned in place and slide about im thinking i have to glue the flowers to the frame but i dont know what kind of glue is best to use i know it needs to dry clear but all i can find is glue for glass and glue for organic materials and this needs to work for both !  ideally it would dry so it could be viewed from both sides but if it ends up needing to be one-sided for practical reasons then thats fine is regular superglue alright ?  the final piece would hopefully look something like [this](https://ipinimgcom/originals/60/af/ba/60afbaf446a179e0ab939879a4491b63jpg) for reference any help and advice would be greatly appreciated ! ,1

7334,going to a craft fair for the first time at a local farm do i need to obtain a sellers permit from the state first ?  previously ive been selling signs locally on facebook marketplace and theyve done very well i make the product end to end short of chopping down trees myself i have some designs that sell well on marketplace with a high conversion rate i think they would do well at a craft fair so i found one a few minutes from my house in about 8 days that will allow me to sell there i dont have a sellers permit from the state it would take 3 weeks to get approved my question is this based on research ive done i know that i can legally sell privately and occasionally from my property as a hobby without remitting sales tax (no different than a garage sale) a craft fair is somewhat scaled up from there and i think would be in commercial sellers territory (if i sold off all the product i have on hand which i doubt will happen id have around $3k in sales) i do have an llc already from a previous company that i can sell under but i dont have a sellers permit because that company sold digital non physical goods have any of you sold at a craft fair and have you gone through the correct legal channels to obtain a sellers permit in your state ? ,1

7371,need inspiration so i have lost confidence in a lot of things in my life recently i bought a long canvas to make something for my mother last christmas but - due to said loss of confidence - i didnt end up making anything with it i still really want to use it somehow but this time to make something for myself does anyone have any suggestions on something fairly easy that looks nice ?  i love the acrylic paintings where they use spatulas so theres texture but i have never even touched a spatula and i really dont have experience with painting on canvas besides the typical wine and canvas parties i dont want to do something completely abstract because i dont necessarily enjoy that type of art - i want to be able to recognize something in it also i love the ocean and sailboats if anyone has experience with these types of projects or you have any pictures that you think would help inspire i would truly appreciate it just googling things isnt getting me anywhere [example of dimensions](https://wwwmichaelscom/artists-loft-back-stapled-canvas/10230614html ? cm_mmc=plasearch-_-google-_-mich_shopping_us_n_artsupplies-privatelabel_n_n_n_n_gos-_-art+supplies&gclid=cj0kcqjw2efrbrd3arisaent0eiwhmcsv0jgewb7dhxu6pfov1sl1k7a8hlczkinipeu80arqvvdivqaanwlealw_wcb),1

7412,has anyone else noticed that big craft stores are focusing more on home decor and less on actual craft supplies ?  ive been noticing this trend over the past few years i feel like big craft giants like michaels and ac moore are using up more and more of their space for home decor and ready-made decorations and less space for yknow actual craft supplies i just stopped by (or should i say took the time to drive 20 minutes to) michaels for some plastic needlepoint canvas and unfinished wooden dowels and they didnt have either in the store i feel like these are such basic craft supplies that i know theyve had for years and which ive purchased from them before how do you not have wooden sticksat a craft store ?  !  this has been happening to me more and more frequently has anyone else noticed this trend ?  i feel like its pushing me to shop online from places like amazon which id rather not support (because of their wasteful packaging and their poor ethics) but its kind of the only option to get everything i need quickly and in one go,1

7546,help with instructions for kids craft involving altering images with glue when i was a kid at camp we did a craft one year where we applied glue to images (nature postcards) and when the glue dried it made it look as though the image was a painting of some kind i tried to reproduce it recently and i seem to have forgotten a step because it just ended up looking like the original image but slightly glossier i remember it had a lot more texture when i did it as a kid does anyone know what this technique is or if theres more to it ?  i used liquid glue from the dollar store it was a fairly sketchy camp so i cant imagine they were using much of their budget on craft supplies &#x200b; any help would be greatly appreciated,1

7759,how to turn handwritten notes into art ?  hello !  i am a creative but only when it comes to music i often have very creative vision for things outside of music but cant execute due to lack of skill/effort haha i am hoping someone here can help me out i have several handwritten notes that have words of encouragement on them that mean a lot to me theres probably 20 to 30 different paragraphs that ive received from people over the years and i would like to turn them into a art piece it is very important to me that i use the original handwriting from each person i dont want to simply turn the words into digital text however i would like to print some type of photo that has them all combined and im not sure where to start or how to put them all together the notes are written on different cards with different backgrounds so when i cut out each note digitally after taking a photo of it they tend to crash a lot are there any tools or ways that i could get just the text and its original form extracted from the background so that i could take all the words and put them on one big page or photo to print ?  if there was a better place to post this please let me know,1

7935,looking for a crafting/macguyver kind of solution not sure if this would be sub to post this in but my parents had ordered the incorrect rolls of credit card paper for our machine the rolls width is fine but its the amount thats the problem they fit if theyre whittled down to half their size by hand-spooling to a previously used black plastic credit card roll i was thinking if we had something like what they use for silk like having two rolls on sticks to hold them up and using a hand crank to spin it until they both reach half of the total while also keeping it aligned so there only needs to be minimal adjustment to straighten it out sounds like its a lot of work for something so seemingly trivial but we have an entire box worth of credit card rolls and we just ran out of the last one that was fixed by hand id appreciate any thoughts on how to go about doing this the only way that pops up in mind is having the three components (crank and two rolls on fitted sticks) be linked together by gears somehow i was initially thinking of it would be made of wood but if its possible to just buy metal parts that could be put together to make something thatll function id be all for that &#x200b; thank you in advance for any help ! ,1

8220,need advice on how much cloth to get im not sure if you guys answer questions like this one so if you dont just let me know and ill delete it im planing on making halloween costumes for my dogs this year i know what i want them to be but unfortunately i cant find anywhere that sells the costumes and the one place i did find is on etsy but sadly a bit too out of my price range i had made a costume for one of them previously for a walk/run/costume contest so im not worried about figuring out how to make it my issue is trying to figure out how much cloth ill need to buy for them it was easier before when i was only making a costume for one (i actually have some extra left over that im trying to figure out what to do with) but im not sure how much more i need to get for them both the one i didnt make one for previously is a bit smaller but not much more than the other so should i double the amount of cloth or does it depend on what type of cloth i use ?  i had used nylon before but im thinking of using something thicker that can still stretch to allow movement since i only used nylon because it was summer and i didnt want him overheating im open to any ideas or help that anyone is willing to give ! ,1

8229,need help with some deep resin casting trying to avoid buying $150 worth of resin to get the right depth so im doing a 3d painting which involves pouring resin and painting on each layer so it ends up with a 3d effect my canvas is a 12x12x2 box in order to get the depth id want i need to have a bit of resin built up first it would take 32oz just to reach a decent depth and buying 32oz of resin just to get the base done seems wasteful is there any material i can use to take up space while remaining invisible in the resin ?  i tried some thick plexiglass but the edges are still visible maybe if i cut it to an exact size it may work but anyone have any better ideas ? ,1

9310,uv resin troubles ?  im very new to crafting and even newer to using uv resin which i decided to try after the cure time of regular art resin became a bit too stressful to work under i like a resin that allows me to perfect little details in the design as long as i care to before curing at the moment im attempting to dome some basic circle pendants just metal backings with a printed image inside the trouble im having is that when i hold my uv light over it the resin warps and lifts up away from the backing plate i end up with basically a hard resin bowl sitting in the center of my backing plate the resin also smokes/steams quite a bit when curing ive considered that maybe the uv flashlight i got for this purpose is too strong ?  could it be causing warping by curing too quickly ?  has anyone else experienced this problem and found a solution ? ,1

9335,advice wanted -- leaving a negative review okay guys i need some advice for once im on the buyer side not the crafter side im about to leave my first negative review ever on an etsy purchase i want to make sure im being fair i purchased a \~$120 branding package which at the time included a pdf/png/psd/ai files of a custom-made main logo two sublogos some fonts and a color scheme/palette i am paraphrasing as after i purchased it and had paid she altered the description of the branding package to no longer include ai files fonts or colors i wish i had screenshotted it after i purchased but i didnt realize that shop owners could alter descriptions after the fact the artwork she made for my logo was lovely and absolutely met the specifications i gave so thats why im not going to leave a 1-star review however when it came time to deliver my final products the psd for the main logo the fonts and the color palette were all missing (the ais were missing too but i didnt really need/care about those so whatever) when i pointed out that psds fonts and a color scheme had been included when i paid she apologized and sent the missing psd but still no fonts or color palette in addition because i was missing the fonts i couldnt use the psds when i indicated again that i hadnt received what i had paid for i was given the name of a single font that will cost me an additional $15-$20 and a hexcode for a single color instead of a palette of colors that would work well together right now im angry im debating between giving her two stars or three stars i feel more like two stars but i want to be fair and i know that im not always fair when im angry,1

9623,how to remove marvy permanent fabric marker (aka the story of a very unfortunate sweatshirt) is there any way to remove this marker from fabric as its intended to be permanent ?  should i try paint thinner bleach hydrogen peroxide or what ?  this is yet another misstep in a hilariously tragic journey of trying to fix an accidental bleach stain on a sweatshirt i have tried both coloring the bleached spot darker so it wouldnt be noticeable and removing color from around the spot with the same intention now for the second time im trying to re-dye it and now ive gotten most of the dye i used last time as well as the original color out of the garment and all that remains is that damned fabric marker on the spots that used to be bleached and are now darker than the rest im afraid that if i try to dye it all over now those spots will still remain darker so im trying to remove the permanent marker and hoping that i could get the spot reach the same tone as the rest of the fabric so i could dye it again because its color was what i liked about it the most from the start so thats what im desperately trying to get back im a little concerned what will be left of the shirt after all these bleaches hot washes etc i already fixes one hole that probably came in the washing machine soon ive probably also splurged the price of a similar new garment to all these dyes and bleaches i hope to get some encouraging advice how to continue as theres no turning back now and i also hope someone could learn from my mistakes,1

9726,new to candle making as a hobby looking for advice and discussion with fellow candle makers hello fellow candle makers my wife daughter and i have recently started making candles as a hobby and working on perfecting them now we started about 6 months ago but quickly got discouraged with the amount of different combos(wicks wax jars pour temp etc) trial/error period and how time consuming it would be to perfect everything all while working raising 4 kids etc we want to start back working on candles because we really enjoy working on them and the process we have decided to just be patient and not rush things now we are using gb 444 soy wax adding the fragrance oil(from aztec) at 175 degrees and pouring at 130-135 degrees weve done a few at 8% 10% and 12% we have used standard 4oz mason jars and 8oz patio jars we have been using premier wicks wi-767 6 1/2 inches wicks for both jars it was the recommended wick on our initial purchase from aztec to use with the 8oz jars the wicks didnt seem to be strong enough for the 8oz jars but seem perfect for the little 4oz jars we have only made about 20 candles in total we have let them cure for 24hrs 48hrs 72hrs 1 week and 2 weeks the cold throw is great but no matter how long the cure time is or how much fo is added the hot throw isnt very strong at all is there another wax like paraffin we can mix with the 444 to help with the scent throw or should we use a different blend all together ?  we have 50 lbs of the 444 soy wax we will be purchasing more fragrance oils jars and wicks within the next week or so because we have ran out of all 3 any recommendations there ?  also we are looking for any advice personal experiences tips tricks combos cure times recommended fragrance oils or fragrance oil companies different jars adding color or anything else that will help us perfect our candlemaking please feel free to comment i would love to hear from some experienced candle makers and learn a lot i plan to be very active in this sub-reddit and i will post our progress along the way thank you all so much in advance pics from most recent candles we made,1

9990,advice needed: giant engagement ring ?  hello !  &#x200b; at my wedding next summer we want our ringbearer to carry a giant engagement ring down the aisle ive seen some cute inflatable ones but im not 100% sold on the idea of an inflatable i feel like i could do it better/classier/more impressively ive seen some giant ones - as in theyre made for people to float in - but hes only three years old and it might be difficult for him to carry one that large &#x200b; so really ultimately i am hoping to craft something i keep going back to the thought of a wreath ring/form for the ring part painted gold but i dont get further than that when i brainstorm how would you guys go about making a large engagement ring that is holdable for small hands ?  it might be cute to have one engagement ring and one regular band (entwined ?  ?  ?  but how to do that ?  ?  ? ) but id be happy with just the engagement ring one if it came down to it its just for the aisle walk/pictures to be cute/unique/funny &#x200b; thanks ! ,1

10313,"can i get some help brainstorming a magnet / craft solution ?  im making a game for my friends and i to play like a group party game personalized for us there is a group of like 20 of us leaving the kids at home and headed out for a vacation and its hard to find something that all of us can participate in together except sitting around drinking alcohol what i want to do is create a game that randomizes each time we play it while also making this very easy to transport its hard to verbalize my vision briefly so i apologize for this text wall imagine a 1"" x 6"" magnet (maybe its needs to be larger so its easier to read) with a sticker on it that says ""play a round of heads up"" then that person has to get 12 clues right or they have to take a drink or something another magnet that says ""name that tune"" and the person has to beat the people to their left and right of them to name a song title first losers take a drink or ""tell us a truth about you no one knows"" now imagine 100 or more of these magnets with things to do on them i want to stick these magnets on to a ""game board"" my vision is that the board will have 26 spots for magnets this way the game is always different we will just randomly grab 26 of the magnets and stick them on to the playing board as they are drawn why 26 ?  well this way we can use a deck of cards to randomize what people have to do so if they pull a red ace (either the heart or diamond) they do the task on the magnet next to the red ace on the playing board **im having a hard time envisioning something that will be the game board** while looking like i put some time into it instead of slapping any old thing together**** the game board will be leaning against the wall or hung on the wall somehow so that everyone can see it from wherever they are standing sitting etc but the game board needs to be metallic or magnetized somehow so that these magnet pieces can stick to it i also need the game board to be easily transported im taking it on a road trip in the back of my car a hard board that might be 2 feet x 4 feet will be hard to keep intact and undamaged for long or many uses something that can roll up would be ideal ive seen some rolled magnet sheets but would that work ?  would i spray some sort of paint over the top of it so that i could ""write"" on the magnet board ?  or maybe i just make more magnet pieces for the red ace black queen etc and just stick them to the magnet sheet instead of try and make their placement on the board permanent ?  i just dont think writing with a marker on the magnetic surface would be visible without putting some sort of top coat on it what would that top coat be ?  or do i just print them on adhesive paper and stick on the board ?  or is this magnet idea dumb and i should go with some other solution i am not thinking of ?  i suppose i could just ditch the board completely and i could just make my own playing cards with the tasks to do on them that would eliminate the board completely but i kind of like the idea of the big board with different stuff if i made it a game with just task cards then every game will end up being the same get through the deck and then repeat or just find a white hard plastic that can be rolled up and use some other sort of attachment solution ?  i guess i could use binder clips or something to attach the ""game pieces"" on to the board if you read this far thanks if you have some ideas then double thanks !  &#x200b; https://ireddit/ll78bj1m1qc31jpg",1

10508,question: diy chips dispenser first of im not sure if these kind of questions are ok to ask here if not please direct me to a more suitable subreddit :) &#x200b; im trying to build a very simple chips/doritos dispenser it is not supposed to be very sturdy since it will be more of a gag project but i would like it to be at least somewhat functional so im planning on just building it out of cardboard or some very thin/cheap plywood im still in the drawing phase but im already stuck on a problem for which id like your input &#x200b; the main problem im facing when thinking about it is how to get the chips out of the dispenser without locking the dispenser crushing the chips or fail to dispense all of the chips i had some initial ideas but after some thought they all had a problem that would make the dispenser impractical to use &#x200b; idea 1: just make a sort of chute you can pull out from the front making the chips fall straight down problem: closing the chute would break the chips still stuck in between the chute also dosing the chips would be difficult since they wouldnt start falling until at least a large portion would fit through the hole &#x200b; idea 2: have a sort of rotating horizontal windmill like structure that pushes stacks of chips in between the spokes over a hole making them fall out problem: rotating the chips over the floor of the structure would likely also break them and (since it will be a low budget contraption) the chips will get stuck in between the spokes and the floor moving all the chips at once would put stress on the spokes either bending them i could solve this by reducing the amount of chips in each section but then it would need some way to refill empty sections and this is a recursive problem :p &#x200b; idea 3: i experimented with a sort of tilting bucket like system where you could turn a knob from the outside tilting a chips-filled container that drops the chips straight down problem: i have had little success with dosing the amount of chips falling out &#x200b; idea 4: have the chips in a hopper feeding a simple conveyor belt that can be turned dropping the chips at the end problem: this sounded complex to build out of cheap materials (read: cardboard) and im not sure this would be any better than the first idea with regards to crushing chips when they enter the conveyor belt since if i can get them falling onto a conveyor belt i could just use that system to drop them out of the dispenser in the first place &#x200b; i have seen videos where they dispense pringels (or other roundish chips) by having them sit on rotating tube that makes them fall when rotated however i think (i havent tested it yet) that this wont work for non-round shaped chips since the center of gravity of the chips wouldnt necessarily be directly over the tube also if at all possible id like the dispenser to be easily refillable either by just pouring out a bag inside the dispenser or have it dispense directly from the bag this also doesnt seem to work for the ones i saw on youtube &#x200b; if you have any tips/hints/thoughts on how i could go about doing this that would be greatly appreciated,1

10900,"any ideas on how to restore/upcycle this thrifted bag ?  i love the style of longchamp le pliage bags but they were always out of my budget so i was pretty stoked when i found this [pale yellow at a yard sale recently but the previous owner treated it pretty badly - it has no shape or structure left (she said its like this because she threw it in the washing machine) and there were a few stains but i was able to get them out the plastic lining inside is also shredded in a few areas it was only a few dollars so i bought it thinking that maybe i could restore it somehow yellow isnt really my colour so i was wondering if there was a way that i could ""cover"" the outside with another cloth preferably in a dark colour like black or gray i was thinking maybe twill or a sturdy-ish cloth i would still like the leather handles and details to be visible as well as the zipper the zipper is yellow but i figure i can always put in a new one and replace the longchamp zipperhead charm on it i also will see if i can replace the lining inside would you guys have any idea on how i could do this ?  im not trying to make a counterfeit bag at all - i just want to turn this thrifted bag into something that ill actually use also is there any way that i could get some structure back into the bag ?  maybe by sewing piping on the inside ?  im a beginner at sewing but im pretty crafty in general im open to any suggestions !  thanks in advance",1

10914,"ideas needed - baby sleep pattern project ive been tracking my daughters sleep patterns from when she was about ten weeks old ive got an awesome [excel now (thats an older version - shes 21 months) but i really want to *make* something out of it (each column is a day so there will be around 700 rows by her second birthday - although i could make one ""thing"" per year so it wasnt so long each day is broken into five minute chunks but i could easily consolidate them into bigger pieces - probably wouldnt want to simplify beyond 15 minute segments though) i do lots of cross stitching so i thought about that but id prefer that it wasnt just something nice in a frame ive considered scarves decorative pillowcases blankets etc but then i get stuck on how to actually make the thing !  i saw [this amazing blanket](https://twittercom/lagomorpho/status/1149754592579600384 ? s=09) today and thats exactly the kind of thing ive been looking for but its knitting :/ ive never been able to get the hang of knitting or crochet - i dont seem to have the dexterity required i love cross stitch because i can easily count the holes stop-start the project fix any errors etc i thought about weaving / loom knitting but im not sure if id be able to switch between colours on one line before i go down the rabbit hole of researching double knitting  can anyone suggest another craft technique to produce my daughters sleep chart ?  thanks !

11124,"polly pocket making advice ?  i was born in 1999 and grew up on (along with barbies and strawberry shortcake) ""fashion polly"" the polly pockets that were three inches with real doll hair and rubber clothes i loved those but recently i learned about the old polly pockets and how they were compacts for kids to take anywhere !  i would have loved that since i personally had lost multiple littlest pet shops and fashion pollies in malls and restaurants so i saw a couple videos of people making there own i am trying to open an etsy shop and i want to ad homemade polly pocket compacts to my items they used polymer clay and tack glue which i have but i dont know what the container should be !  pencil and mint tins are too thin for my ideas so are the nowadays makeup compacts the best thing i saw around the house was retainer cases both me and my brother have one but it will be a couple of years before i stop using mine and many years for my brothers too be available for me to craft with so what items do you suggest and where would i buy them ?  ps if i buy a vintage polly compact and i heat up a exacto knifes blade and can that cut out all the interior furniture ?
