badly damaged exterior wall studs is this out of the purview of a relatively green diyer this is just one of the four studs that need to be replaced or repaired in our shed one of them is worse than this one but i cant access it at the moment all of them have the same damage from i presume termites but there are no termites anymore from what ive read sistering it would be ideal putting new studs on both sides and tying them together through the old stud in that case should i just leave the old stud there there are also the crossboards that are all in pretty good shape should i remove them before sistering the stud is there any danger in that i realize the stud itself pretty much cant be load bearing anymore but better safe than sorry thanks,0

need ideas for converting rain gutter into planter box for reference [photos can be found my wife and i are planning on listing out townhouse very soon we recently had to demolish a previously built addition in the back because of hurricane water damage (side note we essentially brought the space back to its initial state) weve been wanting to improve this back patio area for curb appeal but kept the existing rain gutter (image 1) in case we wanted to re-use it it seems though that the roof overshoots where the gutter would go by a little bit (image 2) so using it as a gutter would be a little pointless plus we dont want to put in too much more money into improvements to add a new gutter that would drain further out into the shared green space ive read about converting old gutters into planter boxes because its such a large piece and already spans the existing length of the back area and also because i do not have a reciprocating saw id rather keep the gutter intact ive seen gutter brackets at hd (image 3) and a case study of gutter/planters installed on fences (image 4) has anyone had experience dong something similar if i get enough brackets would it be strong enough to support the weight of the gutter plus some top soil and plants should i stick to air plants instead thanks in advance,0

"questions about building a deck i recently built a **free standing** deck for a friend we decided to build it without getting a permit first only because of the time frame that we were in and not because of trying to cut any corners we live in upstate ny and the town that this is in didnt have any specifications to building a deck just to follow standard code &#x200b; monday: dug 9 holes to code and poured our 6"" cement base tuesday: placed our 9 6x6 and re-supported until dry wednesday: placed our 3 double beams and built all the joists started to place the deck boards only got about 10 done out of 50ish friday: deck boards and placed 4x4 post for railings (with carriage bolts) saturday: finished railing and all touch ups &#x200b; beginning of the next week he got a letter in the mail from the town code enforcer stating that they noticed ""a structure that looks to be a deck"" on the back of the house etc etc etc now they wanted him to go through the permit process all is well we send everything in and he gets a reply letter it states 3 problems well sorta problems &#x200b; 1 ""please provide a letter showing what the measurements for the post holes depth and what was in place on the bottom of the posts"" it goes on to show different examples of how it can be done okay shame on me for not putting it on the blueprints so this is an easy fix/explanation 2 ""the middle center post of the deck needs to provide a bracket to support the post to the beam"" it goes on to say u can either place the double beam on top of the post and use a bracket or to notch out the 6x6 and place them on top and attach using bolts heres the kicker it explains it a little further and says ""deck beams shall be attached to deck posts in accordance w figure ( which is the notched way or the bracket on top of post) or by equivalent means capable to resist lateral displacement **all bolts shall have washers under the head and nut carriage bolts are not permitted""** the actual problem doesnt list the problem being the bolts only to verify how the center post is attached to the beam i have never heard that carriage bolts cant be used  and is this something that might need to be changed 3 ""all joist hangers are missing nails"" what i know for a fact a so certain fact that i would put my paycheck on it that every hole in all the joist hangers are full except the angled holes i have never heard of the angled holes needing a nail is this something new &#x200b; thanks for your time and help with anything that you have knowledge for ( and please save yourself the time with the ""check your local codes etc etc "" because i know the code i build my deck with the same methods about 15-2 years prior to this and not 1 single problem only difference being the size and the township)",0

should i be fine hanging a 95 lb 32 inch tv in drywall with anchors i recently bought a tv and a mount but i was having issues with finding studs so i bought some anchors and was just wondering if this would be safe to hang it on straight drywall with some anchors id rather not have my tv fall off the wall lmao but ive spent 2 days working on trying to find and figure out the studs to no avail update: ive tried it with a wali arm mount and some 90 lb anchors and it seems to be in there fine it wont come out when i pull on it with all my strength and it seems sturdy enough so far the wall has not exploded and im taking that as a good sign lol,0

freezing washer drain pipe background: my sister-in-law called me a couple weeks ago and told me that every winter her washer drain pipe freezes making her unable to do laundry she asked for my help and i thought id just put some heat tape around it and problem solved so i went over to her house and she showed me the pipe in question it runs out of a broken piece of the foundation and is totally exposed to outside weather my heat tape idea was immediately out for a few reasons most notably lack of an outlet and the location of the pipe complete with being half buried in the ground i tried searching for different solutions but could not find anything suitable or even a similar situation she said she asked a plumber who was out recently and he said he didnt really have any ideas outside of packing straw on top of it that didnt seem like a very good solution to me but using my own knowledge and research has led me nowhere any other ideas on how to deal with this or is the straw the best solution here edit with more info: after getting some responses here i called my sister-in-law and dug for a little more info she doesnt know anything about plumbing but connecting the dots it seems this is the main drain for the whole house the reason she noticed it most with the washer is the washer is the final connection before the line leaves the house she told me that when is gets really cold none of the sinks or bathtub will drain with that said rerouting the pipe likely isnt an option the house was built in the 1890s and plumbing was (very poorly) shoehorned into this house she said that when she had plumbing work done a few years ago they had to rip out the floor in one of her rooms to get to the pipes but the floor was fixed afterward - so even seeing the indoor plumbing at this point is unlikely this likely leaves my options at doing what is possible to the visible portion of the pipe in the picture,0

building a planter box on my balcony rail hi there -- a few days ago my neighbor cut down a great old tree in between our yards i was kind of bummed out at first but today i was sitting on my porch and stunned at how much light it was getting with the extra light it now seems like a great place to grow a few herbs heres [the ive watched a few planter how-to videos and read a couple tutorials but i have two questions that i havent seen answered: 1 how should i fix the planter to the rail i cant build it on top and as you can see from the photos (particularly photo two) the top of the rail isnt flat which means i cant use a piece of metal or something like that 2 i dont have table saw which almost every tutorial takes for granted i can borrow other tools from friends but i dont really have access to the table saw if anyone has answers or suggestions or links to resources that might help me make this thing that would be greatly appreciated thanks for reading,0

"what do you do when the electrical work is difficult to access cannot get to junction box wanted to install a panasonic whisper bathroom vent fan in my master bath last weekend - seemed like an easy enough weekend project that might take an hour or two after watching some videos and doing some reading our house is mostly one story we have one tiny room upstairs but the rest is just attic - which normally makes things easier in so far as accessing electrical is concerned however we ran into a serious road block - it appears our hvac system is on top of the junction box for the electrical work in our bathroom ugh im going to keep digging around the insulation that was blown on top of our ceiling but judging by where it should be (from measuring stuff) it appears its underneath the hvac which is sitting on top of floor boards what now do i need to install a new circuit just to make this work but even then im having trouble imagining how i can install a switch (our original plan was to wire the fan up with the shower light so that it would turn on when you turn on the shower light) because the bathroom current switches are directly under the hvac as well i think creating a new circuit might be beyond our diy skills but im not sure it also seems like overkill secondly - iirc from doing some stuff in our guest bath (which is immediately adjacent to the master) shares a circuit with the master i dont know if that might mean there is somewhere else that we can access electrical in the attic or not as i said i will keep digging around in the insulation hoping to find something but so far i""m not having luck help our tiny bathroom desperately needs a ventilation fan system its too hot (and humid) where we live to open the window most of the year and im constantly battling mold trying to grow in the shower and on the window (yuck) forgive me if im not using proper terminology (correct me if thats the case) - my husband is the one who mostly does the electrical stuff im usually just helping by holding something in place or whatever my diy skills arent really the electrical kind &#x200b; i imagine this is a more common problem for people living in two story homes when you need to access the electrical for light fixtures on the first floor - so im hoping there will be enough people here that can guide me",0

unsure how to remove window ive got these windows around my front door they appear to be fixed double pane and the rubber gasket between the panes is bucking up and its unsightly i want to pull the panes off to fix the gasket buckling but the wooden stops around the inside of the sash are weird im not sure how to proceed it appears to just be a wooden rectangular frame and each side of the stop appears to have one or two holes in or near the middle of the side in which someones tapped a tiny finishing nail (in the direction of the sash not the glass) in such a way that i cant just pull it out but it really looks like if i can just get those nails removed i should just be able to loosen and then pull off the stop and then remove the glass pane does anyone have any experience with this who could tell me how to remove the stops,0

[help] picnic table staining problem [picnic table thanks in advance for any help from the diy community (obligatory long time lurker first time poster) earlier this summer i purchased a build it yourself picnic table kit from lowes for putting on our deck if youve ever shopped at lowes you always see them sitting outside of the store i had been thinking about getting one for the family so i finally bought one when they were on sale in july (if climate and context matter as we get into this question im in the us southeast) i brought it home put the raw lumber together with the included hardware relatively easily and let it sit on our deck for about a week it seems important to note that the four leg pieces are pressure treated lumber but the rest of it is not i purchased a gallon of valspar one-coat exterior stain and sealer the semi-transparent variety that promises 6 years of protection from weather (i bought the cedar color which is fine but it looks kind of orangeish in the photos i took) i sanded the wood and then applied the stain in a single coat after the table had been assembled and sitting outside for maybe 9 or 10 days total very little rain during this time period i would add the problem: after just a few weeks the table started to look blackened if you take a look at the photos youll see what im talking about with the weird bubbly black and gray shapes in the close-up and the black streaking in some other areas of the wood (the really light colored marks and spots are just sidewalk chalk from my three-year-old from yesterday) can anyone tell me whats going on here and what i did wrong and/or what i need to do to fix this is it mold the wood reacting badly to the stain im perplexed at what is causing this and after a couple months it only keeps getting worse thanks,0

moved to a new 4th floor apartment with dangerous windows and need advice as the title suggests i need advice on improving the safety of the windows in my new apartment it is on the forth floor and the windows in the living room open out fully its a really nice feature but unfortunately the sills are only about 35 feet above the floor and honestly its quite scary standing beside them when theyre open it wouldnt be outrageous to suggest you could trip and fall out the window the windows open inwards so i reckoned it would be possible to put bars or wires across the opening to stop anyone from falling out i tried googling a few things but couldnt find any good examples of the best way to deal with this i feel like wires attached to hooks that are screwed into the window reveals could work well and also wouldnt obstruct the view much if this makes you think of anything in particular then any insight or suggestions would be greatly appreciated,0

question: how to make a nuka cola quantum glow hello im crafting a glowing nuka cola quantum from the video game fallout for my girlfriends birthday since i want it to be a decorative object (so not to consumption) i really want it to glow in the dark obviously the longer it works without having to open the bottle and the more evenly the light is spread the better so simply using an led wont bring me the results wanted i thought of making the liquid opaque and putting in a small keychain gadget with the actual glowing radioactive element tritium in it which emits light up to 35 years unfortunately theyre a bit expensive to just give it a shot so does anybode have this keychain and can provide some information on the intensitiy of the light (will it shine through opaque blue liquid) or do you have an even better idea what to use for my purpose thank you,0

"table or handheld wetsaw tile cut advice hi all we are doing full interior renovation am up to the last job need to do about 100m2 worth of floor tiling and a splashback just after some advice have done smaller ceramic tile jobs when i was younger using manual tile cutters and a grinder however we are using porcelain ( 600x600 ) and really want the best results to match the time and effort we have already put in the house i was thinking of using a handheld tile wetsaw for the whole job on a work bench with the rail guide i would like to know if this is a bad idea the reason is i feel as though i find some use for the tool again in the future the other option is the table wetsaw which is a bit more expensive and i probably wont use it for a while i dont want to hire because the job will take me a while being a amateur and we are living in the house so things have to be shuffled around the 2 tools im currently looking at are (ryobi because of their 6 yr warranty and low cost): ryobi one+ 18v 4"" wet / dry tile saw handheld type ryobi 500w 178mm wet tile cutter with folding stand table saw: type with the blade coming out of the table thanks in advance champs",0
is there a rigid piece of plastic that i can buy two of to clamp a brush between for storage sorry if this isnt the right place to ask i have a workbench and id like to put a little thing on the underside of it that can hold the brush that i use to clean the surface after i get aluminum shavings all over it my idea is kind of hard to describe but i feel like ive seen it done somewhere before basically it would be two pieces of plastic fairly close together so that i can squeeze the brush handle between them and they are close enough that the pressure from the two pieces holds the brush in place i made a [shitty drawing](https://iimgurcom/socjpzbpng) if my description is too terrible but the drawing itself is pretty terrible too does anyone know where i could find some little plastic pieces that can accomplish this big thanks in advance,0

measuring depth of foundation hi all the wife and i purchased a home this summer and were looking to add a floor to a room that was an addition itself some time in the past i have a poured patio and i need to measure the depth of the foundation underneath the addition my initial thoughts are 1) rent a hammer drill and bore a 3-4 inch hole through the 4ish inch concrete pad (that is not under the house in any way it just butts up against it) and dig out 3-4 feet with an auger bit to see whats what 2) call a structural engineer and have them do their thing &#x200b; does anyone have any advice or ballpark what that cost would be to get the se out there (im just north of hoboken to get a handle on costs) any advice is welcomed,0

found mold in my attic sprayed with concrobium doesnt seem to be working what am i doing wrong a few weeks ago i ventured into my attic to clean out the dryer vent i found much to my surprise that all of my vents (2x bathroom + 1x dryer) had come undone from the roof ports and were venting warm moist air into my attic i went up this weekend to clear out any moldy insulation which was minimal and to spray concrobium on all of the visible mold this was the general recommendation i saw on reddit for mold remediation the mold is mostly localized to the underside of the plywood roof and some of the beams its the worst near the peak of the roof and around any of the roof vents i would say i have about 500sq ft of mold it ranges in concentration from little spots to large black dense concentrations so i sprayed the shit out of it where it looked the worst and lightly sprayed anywhere that was just starting with mold i went up about 20 hours later the bottle said it should kill it in 2 hours but to wait 24 to paint over it nothing had really changed there were some spots that i had really sprayed the hell out of that looked much better and some spots that i had also sprayed the hell out of that looked the same did i do something wrong maybe i needed to just soak the entire attic do i need to get up there and scrub away the mold has it just stained my plywood forever,0

painting over distemper ceiling any advice we live in the uk in a house built in the late 1950s our lounge ceiling has swirly artex on it but weve been told the ceiling has originally been coated with distemper (which is cheap chalk powder mixed with glue they used it to cheaply quickly decorate house interiors after wwii) we found out we had distemper after trying to paint over the ceiling when we moved in the paint just fell down leaving us with patches and flaking bits all over our ceiling nothing sticks to it my father-in-law things if we mix an oil-based paint (like a gloss) with thinner then itll soak into the pores of the distemper and will stick to the ceiling and cover up all the flakes and peeling bits he says its try that or pay to get the whole ceiling boarded over has anyone tried the oil-based paint solution for distemper will it work,0

"cracking grout hi everyone a few years ago we purchased a house from some self-taught flippers they made some poor decisions and shortcuts most of which weve been able to correct the issue that endures to this day is the cracking grout between the tiles in the kitchen the issue is that the house is raised wood frame construction it was built in the 1940s and the floor is not perfectly level they put down tile that was 24x24 in the kitchen without leveling things out is my guess it creaks and pops in some areas i know that the ultimate solution is likely to remove the tiles and replace them with smaller ones however im looking for suggestions on ways to bring longevity to the existing floor while we save up to replace it what weve done so far: \- purchased ""fix-a-floor"" and stabilized most hollow-sounding spots on the floor this has actually worked far better than i thought it would and i highly recommend the product \- scraped out old cracked grout \- used pre-mixed color-matched grout to fill in all gaps and holes im wondering if there is a product that would mimic grout but is flexible im worried that the tiles themselves will start cracking if the floor is too rigid if the grout was flexible and allowed them a little bit of give im thinking it could help extend the floors life for now",0

"diy | how to install the incra ts-ls positioner on the ridgid r4512 table saw https://ireddit/cldbebug3zq31jpg hey guys i just recently installed an incra ls positioner on my ridgid r4512 table saw and i want to share the installation process with you inca was having a sale and i jumped at the chance this table saw fence is incredible by far the most accurate and versatile fence i have ever seen so let dive into the installation process ***\*please use this post as just a guide refer to the instruction manual for full details*** one of the downfalls from ordering this fence from incra is the shipping lead times which can be up to 9 weeks i talk to one of the incra reps and he said with the tariffs and high demand of the fence the production lead times were stretched to the max i guess that is a good problem to have so when you order be patient its worth the wait the shipment includes 2 boxes (at least mine did) one box for the rails and the other box contains the fence parts and hardware be warned the boxes are quite heavy with the stacked aluminum inside the instruction manual was one of the most well-written manuals i have ever seen each bag of screws and hardware where labeled and included in the steps in the manual so you can easily reference the corresponding part numbers 1 removing the old fence from the r4512 is super easy this fence is absolute garbage and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemies remove all the bolts from the spacer rail the rail bolts under the front of the table at the back of the table and the bolts holding the extension wings (the bain of my existence) good riddance &#x200b; [remove the rails and extension wings](https://ireddit/gltq4b6j3zq31jpg) &#x200b; 2 this would be a good time to give the table saw a good cleaning use an air compressor or a can of air dust to blow off any sawdust wipe down the sides and table with some wd40 also this would be a good time to remove any rust from the top and recoat it with some glidecoat 3 take the rail mounts and attach them to the pre-existing bolt holes you only need to use 2 mounts per side each mount attaches to the 2 end bolt holes of the cast iron top the middle mount is not needed on the r4512 only use the 3 mounts if your saw cast iron top is wider (grizzly powermatic sawstop saws etc are usually wider) space the mounts a 1/4"" from the top once there are spaced properly tighten the bolts so it doesnt shift when installing the rails &#x200b; https://ireddit/k31bvv5r3zq31jpg pro tip: there is absolutely no need to drill and tap any new holes in the cast iron top as others have suggested incra provides several different size bolts the only real issue i had was the back rail mounts but it wasnt really an issue when i figured out to just use the bolts that attached the old back rail it worked beautifully 4 attach the t-nuts to the front and back mounting brackets then slide the rails into place space the rail dead center of the table we will adjust this later [attach the t-nuts that accepts the rails](https://ireddit/gjjup4xs3zq31jpg) &#x200b; &#x200b; 5 tighten the t-nut bolts to secure the rail into place loosen the bolts on the mounting brackets use the positioner arm mounting brackets and clamp them to the bottom of the rails move the rail assembly up or down until the backside of the brackets are flush with the top of the cast iron top this is going to ensure the rails are at the proper height then tighten the bolts to secure the rail mounting brackets [clamp the mounts to the bottom rail and flush the top](https://ireddit/bseg5zcx3zq31jpg) &#x200b; 6 now its time to assembly the positioner arm assemble the stop knobs and insert them into the right side of the rails there are 4 stop knobs 2 on the front and 2 on the back [stop knob assembly](https://ireddit/qr8puqp14zq31jpg) 7 attach the glide pad to the bottom of the positioner bracket install the screw and nuts to each bracket then slide it into play on the positioner cross member leave the screws loose as we will need to adjust its position in a later step [remove the philm and attached the glide pads](https://ireddit/sste4ix34zq31jpg) 8 flip the cross member over and install the positioner into place you will need to space the positioner 11"" from the edge i used a large square and a ruler to get the exact spacing tighten the outside screws to lock it down [slide the positioner into place on the cross member and use a ruler\\square to position it](https://ireddit/zg12som54zq31jpg) 9 remove one of the brackets and slide it on top of the stop knob mount the cross member and positioner on to the rails then slide the opposite bracket and cross member on the backstop knobs then slide the cross member into the front mounting bracket [attach the cross member into the bracket mounts](https://ireddit/5lwbenh74zq31jpg) 10 slide the cross member back so that its spaced 37 1/4"" away from the blade i used the miter slot and measured 32"" because i know my miter slot is 5 1/4"" away from the blade this makes it easier to use a tape measure once the spacing is correct tighten the screws on the mounting brackets to lock it into place [position the cross member 37 1\/4\\"" from the blade](https://ireddit/hf1whs794zq31jpg) 11 attach the front mounting bracket to the positioner arm then slide the arm into the positioner note: there is a small lip on the side of the arm that slides into the receive lip on the positioner once you have those lips engaged the arm slides freely this can be a bit tricky [installed fence mounting bracket](https://ireddit/3k3hpujd4zq31jpg) [slide the arm into place](https://ireddit/uwhkzhff4zq31jpg) 12 slide the fence into the mounting brack of the arm leave the screws loose so we can calibrate it in a later step [slide the fence into place using the bottom t-track](https://ireddit/0byh6rth4zq31jpg) &#x200b; 13 install the fence hold down brackets into the front and back of the fence [install the front and back hold down brackets this prevents the fence from lifting up during cutting operations dont tighten any bolts](https://ireddit/iptk1lkl4zq31jpg) 14 time to make the new extension wings (my favorite part) i made the wings out of phenolic laminated plywood so they will not have any seasonal movement you can use whatever you would like melamine or mdf would be a good choice as well each wing is supported by a pair of cleats rip 2 cleats for each size and then cut them to width according to your spacings the spacings are going to be different according to the size of the positioner you purchased drill holes into each cleat according to the provided instructions in the incra manual attach the clients using washer bolt and nut to the rails make sure the head of the bolts you use is large enough to fit into the t-track on the rail measure the width and length of the openings and rip the plywood accordingly place the plywood on top of the cleats and fastening into place with l-brackets to the cleats on the underside &#x200b; [the plans for these wings can be found in the instruction manual](https://ireddit/uav7qfjn4zq31jpg) 15 final calibration * place a piece of 3/4"" plywood scrap into the miter slot and butt the fence up next to it adjust the arm and position so that its square tighten down the screws on the positioner to lock it into place * place popsicle sticks (2 stacked on top of each other) under the fence space each pair equally down the length of the fence * with the fence mounting bracket screws loose raise the arm until its parallel to the rails tighten the bolts on the mounting bracket test to see if the arm slides easily if it does not slide easily its not parallel to the rails keep adjusting the height until it slides easily this is a crucial step in the process or the fence will not work properly * slide the fence to 1/32"" away from the blade set the fence into micro-adjustment mode by raising the red lever on the positioner to the middle position rotate the red dial away from you until the fence kisses the blade lock the fence into place * detach the magnetic ruler and slide it down the arm until the zero marking is lined up with the line indicator in the positioner window hold down one end of the ruler and attach the rest of the ruler into place make a couple of test cuts and adjust accordingly [if you are interested in watching the full installation video you can find it here: https:\/\/youtube\/juyz5rsvwx8](https://ireddit/homuzfar4zq31jpg) thank you for reading and have a blessed day",0
removal of diverter valve help hello fellow plumbers first off i appreciate any advice here i am removing an old shower dial and its diverter valve in order to install a shower panel with flexible inlet hoses i might get lucky with the work as the shower panel hose fits the male hot and cold water inlet perfectly my question is mostly on the removal of the old diverter valve in a safe manner meaning i dont want my bathroom to look like a pool afterwards 1 is it sufficient to just turn off the valve on the hot and cold water inlet as pictured or do i need to shut off the entire water supply to the house to work on the removal 2 from the close up pic to my surprise the diverter valve appears to be screwed into the cold and hot water pipes as opposed to being soldered in do i simply just unscrew the diverter valve and are there risks for pipe breakage im a little worried about the old pipes and joints the top outlet for the shower appears to be soldered in though 3 there is a piece of wood in the background thats right behind the diverter valve assuming i need to turn the diverter valve for removal can i just cut the wood off without risking structural damage i think its just support for the outlet valve at the top whats the best tool - angular saw hope you guys enjoy my collage of photos thanks all https://ireddit/7efn8hen9zq31png,0

"simple open joint cladding ideas hi all - ive built a small lean-to style shed next to my house the framing is 16"" oc about 65 ft in the front and 7ft in the back (only 27"" depth due to space limitation) the back wall (towards house) is already sided with lp smartside panels but im thinking of being more creative on the other three sides - hence the question on open joint/gap siding i think it would be cool to have a modern geometrical look next to my traditional looking lap siding the main downsides are that some of the purpose-built wrap products - whether 3d grooves for drainage or to be used with furring strips - are insanely expensive and would be wasteful for such a small project the reason i dont like furring strips is that it seems like the gap would be excessive (at least 1/2"" behind the siding) and i have to worry about wasps/hornets in my area so my idea is to sheathe the entire structure with osb and use 30# felt to cover it generously perhaps double layers but rather than putting furring strips i was thinking about attaching each siding panel with a washer or spacer (like 1/8"") behind it and a nice looking ss steel fastener through the siding washer felt and into the osb (maybe the stud) its a small shed i plan to use lp smartside smooth (12"" wide) planks that are cut to right size (so 27"" by 12"" on side walls longer on the front wall) im thinking maybe 1/4"" gap between not sure what would look right until i see it two questions: 1) how long do you think tar paper lasts in the gaps only one side gets sun ill definitely have two layers in each gap 2) would the washers provide enough of a gap hoping someone who has done open joint siding before can chime in thank you",0

stuck on how to install a replacement window in this opening ive been slowly working the way through house replacing windows most of them are traditional wooden windows with a sash cord and so are pretty straightforward to drop in vinyl replacement windows however the last few have been replaced once before using an older system and i am not sure what to do pictures of the system here: from what have found out googling this is some kind of older-style replacement window the channels that the windows are running in are aluminum i would assume that i can just tear the metal bits out however since the replacement windows rest against the outer stop and the stop would be gonenot sure what to do and i cant find any non-destructive way to get it out so once i tear it apart im committed i thought maybe the best approach would be to tear the whole thing out and use a new-construction window -- its on the first floor and i have good external access to the window -- but id really rather not remove the outside trim and possibly siding if i dont have to thanks,0

storage shelf stability im making a standing storage shelf unit there are 4 frame pieces that hold each shelf at each level its strong in all ways but across it seems like if it got pushed to one side at the top while the base was held in place all the frame pieces would fall diagonally in the same direction i dont have any studs to attach it to is there a way i can make it more stable without attaching it to the house i was thinking about connecting the top corner of the frame on one end to the bottom corner of the frame on the other end using a long piece of wood along the back maybe it would be enough to do that between just one frame and the next frame to avoid using a ten foot piece edit: thanks all i added a single plywood panel about 14 inches tall between the two middle frames on the back and the stability was hugely improved,0

an old school desk is new again a friend of mine had an old school desk she picked up at a flea market it was a cool design from the mid-20th century with an amazing oak top unfortunately the desk has been the victim of multiple artistic rehabilitations improper repairs and eventually left in the weather for an extended period of time even though the desk was complete it was really bad condition the project started with a complete disassembly i then moved to stripping off all of the paint first with a chemical striper then wire brushing and ultimately sanding everything smooth all the metal work was repaired then primed and painted with rustoleum primer and spray paint the woodwork was repaired sanded using a variety of methods from 80 to 220 grits and then finished with verathane summer oak and seven coats of a water-based poly gloss clear coat sanded in between at 220 and polished and buffed finally the desk and chair were reassembled and delivered back to its owners i could not have been happier with the result that brought this piece of americana back to it original luster and appearance check out how i did it https://youtube/kghtirfxtx0 #dadityourselfdiy #fixsomething #ryobi #schooldesk,0

converting stove/range from 4- to 3-prong hey diy my partner and i recently bought our first house it was built in the 80s we have a gas range but unfortunately there is no gas line to the kitchen currently we are on a tight budget and so we decided to purchase a used electric range for cheap in the meantime we brought the range home but noticed that we have a 3-prong outlet while the range has a 4-prong cable i decided to try replacing the cable but i noticed that there was absolutely no ground connection after doing some light research and looking at the owners manual for the range ive determined that the ground strap that was originally going from the neutral terminal to the body of the appliance was removed forcefully i brainstormed with my dad and we had the idea of cutting the end off of the ground wire and using that in place of the ground strap **im having doubts because i dont want to make a fatal error could anyone tell me if this will work**,0

"shower base and drain help full disclosure here i am a moderately ambitious diyer but i feel very much out of my league on this project so any help or guidance you can give me would be appreciated im working on replacing the floor tile on my 1960s shower that sits above my garage in our split level house my goal was not only to replace the tile itself because it was very old and pretty nasty but to examine the shower base beneath which i knew was compromised because it had started slowly dripping into my garage below ive pulled up the tile and it was very obvious where water was getting through (to the right of the drain in image #1 below) because the material in this area was soft and somewhat muddy / sandy whereas everywhere else it was firm and hard in the pictures below i have dug out that area to get to the subfloor beneath (which is not very rotted but definitely damp) i was also able to determine (im pretty sure) how water was getting into my garage below if you look at the third picture below you can see my finger pointing to a gap around this flange or whatever on the drain pipe i think this area was saturated with water and that was the release point for any excess water that came through this is consistent with what we were seeing below with water dripping down this pipe on the outside of it you can see a little bit of daylight in picture #4 and this is where my finger is in picture #3 where ive dug out all the way to this part of the drain here are some to show what im talking about so this leads me to a few questions: 1 how was water getting through in the first place my guess is that it was slowly seeping through my tiles in this section of the shower we had very small tiles which means a ton of grout lines it makes sense to me that over time those seals in between tiles were not keeping water out and water was slowly getting below below and here we are the water saturated that section and then the water found a release under that part of the drain shown in the pictures agree or think something else was happening here i understand it could also have been leaking around the mouth of the drain where the drain meets the tile either way that would be a tiles not being sealed well issue right 2 do i need to consider replacing my drain or is it likely fine one thing ive done before ripping up all the tile was to pour copious amounts of water straight down the drain and ive had no issues with water leakage below i really do believe water that gets into the drain is fine i think its just that i had water getting through the tile / base and coming down the side of this drain but if i were to have new tile with new grout and a new moisture barrier / membrane on top of this is my drain likely good to keep as-is or is it one of those things where since ive gotten this far i should look into getting the drain out i dont really want to do it ""just because ive come this far"" but i also dont want to not do it if it really needs to happen if you think this thing is just so old and its likely compromised in ways that im not realizing and it needs to go let me know 3 this leads to my another big question where do i go from here as far as getting ready to put tile back on i have done some research about using either a liquid membrane like redguard or one of the waterproof membrane ""rolls"" but is that something i could apply on top of this existing base (shown in image #1) or do i need to consider removing all of this old base and getting down to my subfloor my thought has been that most of this material is in tact and solid except where it was damaged on the right side so perhaps i should build on top of this layer in other words get my subfloor dried out and patched up then fill in the chunk that ive taken out (with what some type of mortar mix) and then use this as my base layer that i start rebuilding tile and if so what do you recommend doing next do i apply a waterproof layer on top of this and then some sort of prefab shower tray (like schluter kerdi) on top of a thinset mortar then put more thinset mortar and tile the biggest issue with this layer currently is that its not perfectly smooth since the tile pulled up some of this layer with it and its a bit splotchy does it make more sense to not use a prefab tray and to just refinish this layer with some type of overlay (keeping in mind the pitch etc) and then waterproof it and tile it or is that prefab tray a good way to go just because it has the right pitch its made of a good material etc i know thats a lot of questions but hopefully my general question makes sense: how do i get from where i am now in these pictures to a place that is ready to tile 4 obviously if i do use this base layer as my foundation on which im going to re-tile and if i do build on this layer just a little bit with waterproof membrane mortar etc then my new tile is going to be raised slightly higher than my old tile which will make it hard to seal around my drain do i consider something like one of these ""extend o-drain"" [kits](https://wwwamazoncom/extendo-o-drain-extend-o-drain-4-3-8/dp/b007bv6ed8/ref=asc_df_b007bv6ed8/tag=hyprod-20&linkcode=df0&hvadid=198111101494&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14607906552616376246&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012564&hvtargid=pla-351737196878&psc=1) that raises my drain by 1/4 inch or is that a poor solution do we just go back to point #2 and say you need to replace your drain if i do need to go this route of replacing the drain any kits you would point me to that make this easy or is this definitely a ""call a plumber"" step i recognize that removing the current drain might be tricky even though i do have access from below as you can see from picture 4 any other major tips or pointers you would give me any videos that are a must watch ive done a good bit of research but wanted to be able to ask about my specific situation since i am a bit out of my league so thanks in advance for any input and again in case you missed them the",0
bathroom vent fan leaking water question hi i have a bathroom vent fan leaking water during certain conditions and id like to know how to fix it the vent opens on a north facing roof and it is on a slope the water drips back in the vent fan on the second floor when there is snowfall and then warms up and melts as winter progresses it will also happen after a shower and the steam is vented up the same fan it is only during these conditions that there is water dripping back in i had someone come in and make sure the vents were connected to the vent caps through the attic and it appears the seals are ok the insulation around the bathroom fan and the attic seems to be adequate too visual inspection of the roof from thr ground appear to have snow built up around the vent cap the snow doesnt melt properly due to location angle of roof some other cause i dont know what else could be causing this to happen under the environmental conditions described i should also say during summers with rainfall nothing out of order happens my question is what is it how can i get it fixed what diy stuff could i do thanks,0

should i remove insulation from the inside of my masonry century home i just purchased an 1888 victorian style home in northern utah one of the things that attracted me to it other than the price was that it had 10 foot ceilings hidden behind dropped ceilings i knew this because in some places the ceiling was dropped with commercial style boards some spots were dropped with drywall on top of some other type of board that resembles ceiling tiles i knew i would remove the drop ceilings throughout the home to get the lost space back what i didnt expect to find is that the home had all of the exterior walls framed out and batt insulation installed the insulation only goes as high as the drop ceiling or a foot above with vapor barrier between the insulation and drywall in areas where the ceiling is dropped with drywall there are insulation batts above everything ive read about masonry buildings says that insulating on the inside is a huge no-no because it causes freeze thaw cycles that damage the bricks the home was wrapped in aluminum siding likely before the insulation retrofit so i cant inspect the bricks from the outside without significant cost the question is do i take down the insulation to prevent further damage or leave it and hope that the home doesnt fall over,0

how long do pressure treated deck boards take to shrink to final size tl;dr - decking lumber sat in garage about a month and then out on deck for a few weeks before being installed i still installed them very close because i didnt want large gaps once they shrink down to size now im worried i should have left larger gaps since they had already partially dried help this summer i started restoring our ~350 sq ft deck i decided to remove all the decking which was 2x4 boards with huge gaps between each this part of the project took a while because i was saving each board and removing all the nails to reuse them for garden carpentry type of jobs i also did the same for the railings the frame was in good enough shape to use again came to be that the joists were around 30 apart so i needed to put them in between i ordered my lumber pressure treated pine and had it all delivered at the beginning of august i installed the joists and used a stain and sealer on the parts i was keeping after sanding and power washing by the time i was ready to lay decking my job as a teacher had started again as well as grad school by the time i got to start installing the decking last week some boards had been out on the deck waiting to be installed for a couple weeks i installed them close (about 1/16) but some touch in areas im afraid i wont get a big enough gap now ive read about wood being so wet its oozing when you put a screw in it that wasnt the case for me im about half way done and am looking for advice before i start the half that requires cuts to fit around posts and the house should i go back and give them more space like 1/8 or am i good and they will still shrink enough to give me the gaps i want we hated the huge gaps in the original deck and wanted to avoid that edit: i live in pennsylvania it was a usual humid and hot end of summer now the temps and humidity are quickly dropping since its fall thanks in advance for your advice,0

remove concrete resurfacer so i recently embarked on a flooring project in my kitchen and living room i removed the vinyl plank flooring that was separating at the short joints in the kitchen i found original hardwood floors (my house was built in 1925) in the living room however there was ugly linoleum underneath that was the hardwood so i removed all the vinyl planks and underlayment and discovered some moron (either the flippers who sold me the house or the previous owner) had cover 3/4 of the perimeter of the linoleum with that concrete resurfacer stuff removing the linoleum in the center of the room was straight forward enough but the edges covered in concrete resurfacer are a nightmare im hacking away at this stuff with a flat pry bar and a hammer its extremely tedious and slow going any tips on how to remove this crap would be welcome,0

custom desk build question hey diy-ers i have a few newbie questions for you i am working on a custom desk for my pcs i have been liking and researching the builds with filing cabinets as supports (all the ikea ones) my problem is i need a long desktop (10ft) so my thought was what about a laminate sheet (like this onehttps://wwwhomedepotcom/p/wilsonart-3-ft-x-10-ft-laminate-sheet-in-coffee-bean-with-standard-matte-finish-d4956035036120/203381748) or would that be too rough at the edge where my arms would rest theres none available at hardware stores near me to check them out in person they have the cut laminate ones but they are all patterned and id rather have a solid color also for that length would you suggest a middle support of some kind i am considering just doing three filing cabinets with one in the middle kind of separating the stations anyways bear in mind for all this i do not have fancy tools (yet just bought my house lol) so i am working with a power drill and thats about it for nice tools x d i really appreciate any input thank you,0

easy privacy shutters for bathroom window made from painted rulers and pvc pipe ive had this up for almost 2 years already wanted to share my [diy privacy shutters which is my solution to a window that is placed at chest level right in our shower area the shutters allow us to keep the window open but also provide us privacy we keep the shower window open at all times to promote airflow and prevent moisture and mold since the previous owners did not install an exhaust fan (probably because they chose a window instead) the other bathroom doesnt have a window but does have a fan a curtain would be the immediate solution for privacy but it would constantly be wet the perimeter is made out of pvc pipes and elbows connected to fit the inside of the window make sure to take in your measurements to account for when the elbows slide into the pipe that shortens your measurements i didnt account for that and only measured the full length of each of the pieces and forgot that it still has to slide into the elbow and i will lose some inches but in the end i got lucky and it still fit it was good anyway because since it was smaller i was able to wiggle it in diagonally when assembled and i also made it shorter than the actual opening so that it can stand upright as i slide the window close on top of it to hold it in place i drilled holes along the sides of the pipe and these are where the pins go i took home depot rulers and cut them to size by assembling the frame first and then measuring from one end of the inner perimeter to the other end and used that measurement to cut the rulers this also makes sure there are no big gaps at the top of the rulers when installed then i coated them with white water resistant paint- similar to what they use on bathroom walls- i think spray paint would have been easier i did 2 coats by hand and that was the longest part one thing i would suggest is that the rulers that are on either end closest to the vertical pvc frames should be wider or fatter because the elbows prevent it from swinging fully closed so there is a larger gap maybe super glue two rulers together at the edges to make a wider one for those ends i hammered some stainless steel nails to both of the edges of the ruler leaving a big portion of it sticking out so it can be inserted into the holes you made in the pvc pipes since the ruler is so slim you want the thinnest nails so you dont split the ruler when you nail it in the rulers swing around if you want to open them or close them by hand exactly like shutters just make sure when you are measuring where to put the holes in the pipe that the rulers lay slightly on top of the other as to prevent huge gaps where people can peek through when you put it in the closed position to assemble the rulers i first put all the pins on the top side then i lined up the pins on the bottom and i closed the pipes together this was tricky since there are a lot of holes and pins and lining up i recommend a second person to help important: people recommended that i install an actual exhaust fan since airing moisture out with a window is inefficient so please dont do this if ur only trying to exhaust a bathroom if you like to shower with the window open but want some privacy and have extra airflow then this can be good for you note that i also live in southern california where keeping the window open is not a huge issue all year round,0

diy miniature tensile testing machine hi everyone i was suggested to share my machine here so i do it [miniature tensile testing machine](https://ireddit/exr702hz3kq31png) during the last 15-2 years i was working on a miniature tensile testing machine in my free time during my job i work a lot with materials testing and ive always been interested in tinkering so this project is a good combination of everything originally i started to work on this project because i was working with a machine which had a very poorly written software and i was not satisfied with it also the mechanics of that device was a bit poorly designed so i though i could improve this the presented project is still under development but the machine is already fully functional and works quite well at this moment there are two big challenges firstly i have to solve the problem with the displacement measurement for some reasons the caliper picks up some noise and i could not find the source of it so far whenever i connect the power supply to the controller of the stepper motor the numbers on the display of the caliper go crazy i tried different stepper drivers different power supplies but nothing helped so far i still havent tried to power the caliper from a separate psu so i have to check it but i suspect that the noise comes from somewhere else maybe i should shift the logical level of the caliper as close as possible to the pcb of the caliper and carry the already shifted signal to the arduino as you see it now the signal from the caliper is carried to the main box (with a shielded cable) and the level is shifted there i also have a plan b i recently bought a dro scale i have to figure out how to read the signal of it with arduino (i just recently received it so i havent really checked anything) and maybe it will be a better solution also it is more robust so it should work better with this machine secondly i want to compress the device into a more compact format there are already plans for this but i am very busy and i am also a bit short on resources (for example cnc and other stuff) i show a 3d-printed part in the video which i use to hold the shafts and bearings that would be one idea to make it more compact however i started to design something with individual bearings and l-shaped profiles but i still have to make some drawings measurements and some preliminary assembly to see how i can implement the new design [sketch of the l-profile-based power transmission \(gears and shafts\)](https://ireddit/gjfta2114kq31jpg) i made a video for you guys because it is more easy to explain it by speaking than writing a novel and it is also better to see the actual parts that i talk about[explanation](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=jsf6cwc6gti&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m&index=2&t=0s) this is a closeup video of a sample and at the same time you can see the evolution of the tensile curve: [testing of a steel sample (closeup view)](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=pnz2b1gsjty&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m&index=4&t=0s) i also have a series of videos where you can follow the project from the first iteration [playlist for the whole project](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=jsf6cwc6gti&list=plaeii4gbl1t9_tok-mwgmbdwcfcramq4m) i was asked for the parts so this is the list with an approximate price in usd not all but all the main components are on the list \- base plate (laser cut custom design) - $35 \- nema23 15:1 stepper motor - $75 \- tb6600 stepper motor driver - $10 \- digital caliper - $8 \- circuits for caliper (dc-dc converter level shifter) - $3 $2 \- gx16 connectors (34 and 5 poles) - $10 \- 5 kn load cell - $62 \- ek08 support bearing (for the shaft for the worm gears) - 2 x $13 \- crosshead pieces (laser cut custom design) - 6 x $7 \- 1m-20t worm gear set (gear and wheel) - 2 x $12 \- twin lead screw with nuts - 2 x $ 42 \- custom made grips (cnc custom design) - 2 x $53 \- pillow bearings - 2 x $265 \- bk10 support bearing (main bearings for the lead screws) - 2 x $12 \- arduino and other circuits (uno nano hx711) - $3 $2 $12 \- power supply - $15 \- plastic box - $8 \------------------------------------- sum \~ $550 but this is a very rough estimate since the price of the custom made parts can vary i also havent considered the cost of the tools and small parts that i already had at home or i actually had to buy small screws spare parts wires soldering stuff etc furthermore the hours i spent on design programming assembling and disassembling this several times etc the reality is more close to $1000 if you want to buy everything from a proper seller and in high quality i bought most of the stuff from china from random sellers from alibaba (in fact i am very satisfied with them and those products) and from other mostly chinese websites the system is capable of measuring much larger forces (about 20 kn) easily but based on the current load cell i am limited to 500 kg it is really difficult to find cheap and small load cells with higher capacity i am still working on this machine and hopefully i will be able to turn it into a nice product at the end the programming part is about 90% done (some improvement can be done and i want some more fancy features) so most of the work should be done on the mechanical part i will do more tests with different materials in the future and i will also publish them as videos,0

which type of unvented gas heater is best for an unfinished basement (infrared or convection) i say unvented because it will not be an always-on heater basement stays 55f-65f on coldest days with no heat occasionally i will need it to be more comfortable for using the shower down there i know infrared is a more comfortable heat to feel but i think it is best when it is spread out rather than concentrated in a single spot my problem with it is that the gas hookup for it is around 30 from the bathroom im thinking convection might be better for heat dispersal i currently heat the house with a gas furnace and there are 2 vents down there already would it make more sense economically to just open those vents and/or add 2 more,0

overhead garage shelving into a steel framed home,0
good afternoon i make such lamps,0
retractable tennis ball stopper - cord length hi &#x200b; today i installed a fixed length tennis ball stopper in the garage some yt videos suggest to make it a retractable stopper by connecting the cord with the upper end of the garage door (eg [https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=0695k47qtdy](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=0695k47qtdy) ) which looks very neat since our car has a windshield at a height closer to the ceiling than in most of those videos (tennis ball hangs at lowest point possible wrt the windshield) what happens when i hook the cord to the garage door is that the ball gets pushed all the way in to the ceiling before the door reaches the final position how can i implement a simple mechanical solution that helps alleviate this issue i dont want to add any further arms or stiff extensions to the garage door but rather simply work with the cord itself and maybe a more intelligent way to route the cord along the ceiling,0

"problem with a new radiant heat install hello all image of my setup: my kitchen flooded back in february and i decided to completely gut it as it could have been a set on that 70s show as part of the renovation i decided to put in radiant floor heat under my tile i did a bunch of research on them back when i decided to do it (march) and have just now finished plumbing it in the rest of my house is heated with a gas fired boiler going to the baseboards i plumbed the new radiant system into this with a mixing valve to bring the heat down to 120 ([https://wwwpexuniversecom/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free](https://wwwpexuniversecom/taco-5004-c3-g-mixing-valve-lead-free)) im having two issues right now 1 how can i make the circulator for the radiant fire only when the radiant thermostat calls for heat i put the baseboard thermostat on zone 4 as this taco 404 controller is supposed to only trigger the end switch when a zone except 4 is calling for heat but that doesnt seem to be working i dont want to make the radiant my priority zone because i plan to add more zones in the future as im working on the house 2 the circulator doesnt seem to be pumping correctly is the turn too close to the output of the pump i know i was reading that theres supposed to be 12"" of pipe before the circulator not sure about after im not seeing any gpm on the flow gauges on the supply lines just fyi the shutoffs connecting to the boiler supply and returns were open during testing ive since disconnected the circulator and shut them off so i can run the baseboard heat until i figure it out status lights on the circulator are on and i can hear it so it should be pumping i can work around #1 right now by swapping the radiant to the priority zone and using that end switch so thats not as big of an issue right now but id appreciate any comments that can help with that my big problem right now seems to be with getting flow through the system thats a variable speed taco pump ([https://wwwpexuniversecom/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump](https://wwwpexuniversecom/taco-vr1816-viridian-variable-speed-circulator-pump)) as i planned on adding more zones in the future so it should be able to handle it on max load but im seeing nothing oddly enough i get more heat on the supply side than through the mixing valve im thinking i need to add a check valve on the return as i was seeing 120 at the return and 70 at the supply i appreciate any advice yall can give me as to how to solve these issues or how i may have messed up the plumbing",0

im building an induction heater and button isnt working im building an induction heater and im currently testing out my button its a push button thats supposed to stay on while i have it held down and then turn off once i let go its connected to a 12v power supply and the induction heater is also a 12v as far as wiring goes i have the blue wire connected to the red wire which the red one is connected to the positive terminal of the induction heater the black wire is connected to the brown wire which the brown one is connected to both negative terminals of the induction heater and the power supply adapter the white wire is connected to the positive terminal of the power supply adapter the issue is when i press the button the led turns on and then immediately turns off again both on the button and the induction heater i have the wiring in their correct terminals with positive and negative but im not sure what could be the issue here ive also tried a second induction heater to rule it out as being the issue the only thing i see that could be the issue is when i press the button the power supplys led turns off is it a bad power supply thats causing this i dont have a second one at the moment to test this out [heres the video to see what im talking,0

question - how bad is installing duct work insulation and a crawl space i was hoping to get the opinions of people here who have installed their own insulation in a crawl space our house has an older ac/heating system and the insulation on the ductwork has been there for a while i noticed that there are some spots where it is in pretty bad shape and has started drooping and falling off the ducts themselves look okay but there are spots where the insulation will need to be replaced how painful is installation is this something that is better left to the pros i would rather do this myself than hire someone in order to save some money but dont want to dive in if it is going to be a horrible experience i got one quote for the work and it came in at $700 which i thought seemed high for roughly 5-6 feet of insulation replacement,0

what is the best way to reduce sound travel down hallway/stairwell so i dont hear sounds in bedroom i just moved into a townhouse where my bedroom is directly on top of a straight staircase and down the hall from the master bedroom sound seems to funnel into this room from both directions the townhouse is all tall ceilings and entirely hardwood floors so even a song played in the entryway on the first level from a cell phone can be clearly heard from this bedroom on top of the stairs similarly music played in the master echos all the way to my room and downstairs into the living room (yet in the master bedroom you can hear nothing from the rest of the house) it seems to me that the issue is these long hallways reverberating this sound along white walls and hard floors rather than sound leaking through the floor or ceiling what is the best way to significantly reduce this noise travel in the hallways i have considered carpet runners but i wanted to get feedback from someone on here before i make any expensive purchases im skeptical that a thin carpet will make much of a difference are there possibly affordable sound panels,0
mounting a tv and floating entertainment shelf how should i go about setting up an outlet [here is a crudely drawn version of what the tv and entertainment shelf will look like mounted on the from my understanding it is against code in most areas to run high voltage (power) chords behind the wall so i am guessing i will need to install an outlet behind the tv and possibly behind the floating shelf as well this wouldnt be too big of an issue but as you can see in the photo the outlet dead center on the wall is a coax outlet the only two outlets i have on this wall are both to right and left of the coax outlet i would like to hide the wires behind the wall if possible but given the circumstances i am unsure if i will be able to while also staying in code i know i can connect a new outlet to an existing one but i am also guessing trying to connect a new outlet dead center will be troublesome as the two available outlets are likely separated by several studs if you have any recommendations or solutions please let me know i am fairly new to this so if i absolutely need to hire someone or just deal with some visible wiring i have no problems doing so thank you all in advance edit: thank you all for the responses i think i have a general idea of what i am going to do if all goes well ill upload a picture of the completed set up,0

neutral to single pole setup hey diy &#x200b; looking to add a neutral wire to my switch in a single-pole setup it looks like the neutral goes to the light first and then the white going to the switch from the light is actually hot with the black wire going back being the load ive read the following thread and post by /u/daole: [https://wwwredditcom/r/diy/comments/5ma6ie/add\_neutral\_to\_wall\_switches/](https://wwwredditcom/r/diy/comments/5ma6ie/add_neutral_to_wall_switches/) (unfortunately archived and i cant reply there) but essentially where im stuck at is this i have into the fixture a white black ground black goes to white (wirenutted) and out to the switch black back to the fixture at the switch white goes to hot black to load and back out to the fixture into the load-in what im confused at is this: if i add 2 wires going from the switch to the fixture (white/red) at the fixture i pull the black wirenutted to the white apart and connect it to the old black (therefore black will be hot at the switch red will be load) connect the red to the load on the fixture now at the fixture i will have 4 white wires (fixture to wirenut white in from source and 2 whites going to the switch receptacle) do i wirenut all 4 together then at the switch i will have 3 whites (switch to wirenut 2 whites going to the fixture receptacle) do i wirenut all 3 together seems to me i wouldnt really need to bring in 2 new wires all i really need is 1 new red wire from switch to light fixture but i guess we run the full 3 wires because they come sheathed together ive searched for hours to find diagrams but unfortunately theres no single pole diagram that starts at the light and passes neutral to the switch (that i can see anyway) thank you,0

how do i approach adding artwork to a guitar body that has an acrylic finish my dad is working on a guitar gift for a singer friend and asked me to do the art (mostly because hes unwilling to pay a professional) i am an experienced artist but im finding this not to be very simple i thought hed had just a base coat put on an unfinished body but instead he just bought a guitar with a fully finished acrylic seal in the color he wanted not a great start but im wondering if this is still something i can work out he just wants a simple leaf pattern painted on the edge of the face that we can then finish to protect it is there a way to do this over the acrylic finish and have it work and not look like shit or is he asking too much i worry about stripping the finish (if thats even possible) because it could destroy the color and ive got no experience doing that or putting a new finish over the art im curious what options (paint decal etc) are there to get this artwork on the guitar the way he wants it,0

junction box in attic i hope this isnt a stupid question i almost posted in the r/electricians page seemed like a bad idea anyway home is located in wisconsin ive been doing a lot of wiring in my house and in order to facilitate future splices for additional lights throughout the house i wanted to install a junction box in the attic its not covered with insulation posing any hazard etc i decided to start a new circuit for these lights there is one hot line running into it directly from the panel and connected to one other light the intention is the have a good source to splice into run other lights from in the future &#x200b; i am being told this is illegal and all junction boxes need to be accessible on the livable floor (for lack of better term) is this person confusing with simply having the box be accessible at all because it is i cant seem to find anything solid reflecting this language about unlawful attic j-boxes in the wisconsin electrical code but im not super well versed in this &#x200b; tl;dr i want to install a junction box in the attic is this legal or not,0

can i drill a hole into a soffit to run the cable for a wifi camera im interested in installing a wifi camera outside of my front door my house has a brick wall and i do not want to drill a hole through the brick for the power cord (im fine with drilling the mount into the brick though) above the front door is a soffit that provides ventilation for the attic i have a power outlet in the attic that the power cord can reach i would just need to drill a hole through the soffit to run the cable is there any reason that drilling a hole through the soffit would be frowned upon i want to make sure that i wouldnt be messing anything up by drilling through the soffit i figured that it wouldnt be a problem since the soffit itself already has several small holes for ventilation as it is below are pictures of the front door and the soffit that im talking about i would install the camera above the top right side of the front door,0

"trying to repair stuck wash machine too eager hi found info and 75% sure i can fix my wash machine however early in the process of pulling apart my na-series panasonic machine i got eager and pulled out the blue plastic main agitator / pulsator disc at the base the screw is about 125"" long (3cm) with a rubber washer seal on it https://bigwarehousesparesausappspotcom/images/646676jpg upon changing my mind and trying to put the screw back in it would only go down about half way and stop picture of it here https://iimgurcom/armg6gppng so i guess maybe the inside where the screw goes got water inside it it appears to just be a screw holding the blue plate in https://iytimgcom/vi/7wgpmfpwymi/maxresdefaultjpg quite similar to this have i got water down a thin shaft and nuked my primary spinning motor or have i got water in a small cavity i just need to dry out before putting the plate back in (water being incompressible) (my concern is the rubber washer - telling me water should probably not go down this hole and some did) as for the actual non draining u11 code on the washer i actually think ill have that solved (bra underwire was loose inside under that pulsator / agitator plate) thanks any and all the internet is great sometimes",0

securing handrail posts into soil im looking at installing handrail in a family members garden and could use some advice im planning to use kee klamp (or a knockoff version): https://simplifiedbuildingcouk/handrail/kee-klamp-handrail for the railing itself unfortunately all the parts ive seen are for attaching it to a concrete path there is a concrete path in the required location but it is only 90cm wide so i cant use it to fix the handrail posts without making it too narrow for bins / wheelchairs / etc quick sketch: i have 9 posts that need to go into the ground this is my current plan: - i want 1m posts above ground so i think burying 50cm should be enough ill therefore need 15m posts - the ground is fairly soft im thinking ill dig down most of the way with a post digger then hammer the posts in the last few cm so theyre stable enough for the next steps - ill secure each in place with postcrete leaving the level a few cm below ground so i can surround the posts with grass my main questions: - do i need to worry about the tubes filling up with water and rusting the bottom end would be open to the soil so id hope it would drain away and the top will be pretty much sealed - do i need to attach anything the the tubes to stop them pulling out vertically or will friction be enough - do i need to drill any drainage holes in the side of the tube at ground level to let water out - the tubes are galvanised steel but ill be cutting them to length myself do i need to coat the cut ends in any way before they go in the ground,0

anyone use the ez-level for kitchen cabinets we used them in our kitchen because our floors are so unlevel (we fixed the uneven dips and peaks but then whole floor slopes to the front of the house) they actually made installation a lot smoother than using all the shims at the hardware store however now the cabinets on the low point of the floor are about an inch and a half off the floor the toe kick will cover it but is the ez-level going to hold should we shim under the cabinets just for added security it says they are rated for 700lbs so they shouldnt move when the countertops are installed but i guess i am just paranoid any help would be greatly appreciated and look forward to a post in the near future about our full kitchen remodel that has been going on since november 2018 picture for reference of the floating cabinet: edit: i should add that the cabinets on the other side of the kitchen are fully on the ground the floor apparently slopes about an inch and a half every 10 feet,0
"boarding up doors and windows with planks of 2 x 6 pressure treated lumber will this resist burglar kicks its only 15"" inches thick actual size sanity check before i waste my money and do something stupid im a total amateur and dont have many tools or an actual workshop just posting here because you guys might know the answer planning on boarding up some doors/windows on a property to prevent more burglaries (seems extreme but thats what i need to do without going into specifics) **i have a gap thats 31"" wide there is 2 and 1/4 inch wide wood ""frame"" on either side (kind of thin frame)** (and it goes deep so i could use long screws if i need to) **if i board it up using 2"" x 6"" (and ~35"" long) pressure treated lumber would it resist strong kicks (its nominally 2"" but in reality 15"" thick)** on each side id be nailing and screwing it in with non removable screws to that 2 1/4"" frame this is the wood i plan to use: https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/weathershield-2-in-x-6-in-x-8-ft-1-ground-contact-pressure-treated-lumber-253905/206966039 this is a diagram which explains it a lot better https://iimgurcom/du831japng i plan on painting over all the edges to make it a little harder to grab with a crowbar * question: would the above plan resist being kicked in its 15"" thick of solid wood only supported at the ends i mean strong kicks the type they use to kick open doors ive seen those videos where karate guys break wood with their hands so im starting to doubt whether this would be strong enough to resist hard kicks * question 2: if i did the same basic design but instead of using 2 x 6 wood i used plywood (either 23/32"" sheathing plywood or 1/2"" ground contact plywood) would it be equally strong more strong less strong * question 3: what if i combined the wood and the plywood would it then resist kicking i would nail the plywood to the wood and sloppily glue the plywood to the wood (i dont have clamps so the glue may not be strong) * question 4 what about just plywood like question 2 but 2 stacks glued together (i dont have clamps so the glue job wouldnt be high quality id probably just put random things over it like books and whatever i dont have a lot of heavy stuff) thanks guys",0

any tips on finding studs so in the following image ive marked all areas that sound/feel hard with green tape only issue is that when tapping the wall vertically from points it goes hollow and back to solid (as shown by green tape) i expect this horizontaly as studs are meant to be 400/600mm apart but unsure as why i its not solid the whole way up in addition been trying to use a stud finder but never seems to get a solid reading read about using a magnet ordered a supposed strong magnet online as magnets ive had in the house dont reveal anything (assume they are too weak) and i know to drill into the wall to test studs but want to avoid drilling into the wall untill im more confident about possible stud locations as currently they seem to random anyone experienced this im from uk and trying to wall mount monitors so trying to avoid use of anchors,0

piano as shelve - keeping the keys dear subreddit in the family we had an old piano which could not be tuned any more and after seeing https://wwwredditcom/r/damnthatsinteresting/comments/cgrmki/a_repurposed_piano/ i wanted to give it a try as well [so i started to remove as much as possible without damaging the corpus] (https://iimgurcom/viduzqejpg) &nbsp; [first the heavy cast iron (damn its really heavy to lift from that height) the legs and the keys](https://iimgurcom/w3wtcjmjpg) &nbsp; [next the whole inside wooden parts to have space for the shelves for which i plan to at least partially use the top lid to reuse as much as possible from the original parts](https://iimgurcom/ql4jlk2jpg) &nbsp; now i noticed that when the keys are vertical (which they will be on the wall) theres no more gravitation pushing the hammers onto the keys that means the keys go in their downwards position but since the hammers are not pushing against that the keys remain there as if pushed down permanently https://iimgurcom/440rjqqjpg i am now looking for ideas how to keep them in the initial position first i thought to lock them down with screws thats easy but i wont be able to push them any more so i am trying to find something which will push them back this is how it looks below they keys: i have two ideas so far which have both their downside: &nbsp; 1 put some kind of foamy/spongy marterial below so i can push the keys down and they go up again its easy/cheap but i bet that the feeling would not be even close to pushing the keys on a functioning piano and also fear that the foam might not endure long time 2 spings but it will be hard to find fitting ones and i am not 100% sure how to twirl them around the metal peg: https://iimgurcom/na2ht6gjpg &nbsp; any help would be awesome :) thanks in advance,0

putting up temporary/fake wall into an apartment without screwing into the ceiling the room is the basement of a duplex with a spiral staircase opening to the living room above this means light and sound go right from one room to the other one side can be done easily without any help some curtains would be added but the other side needs a little ingenuity we dont have to be fancy plywood is a fine start and it can be decorated from there the ceiling is only about 7 so not particularly high which is actually an asset for this project i was thinking about putting furniture feet pads on to the ceiling to stop scuffing though i need to figure out how to properly stand the board up i was thinking about wedging the plywood on either side of it to keep it up and even but that doesnt really sound that logistical maybe adding 8th-inch plywood down on the bottom until it creates a proper lift no ideas are bad ones,0

recessed screw turning but wont come out my cordless vacuum has been acting a little temperamental and the manufacturers advice is to check on the battery connections in order to remove the battery i need to remove a couple screws the one in the image is turning but not really coming out at all its partially unscrewed and feels a little loose generally the research ive done so far suggested using a flathead screw driver to pull from behind the head of the screw or using pliers but because this is recessed by about 1/2 i cant do that ive also tried holding it upside down while i screw (hoping gravity will help) and used strong magnet with no success any advice,0

arc welder in place of variac & transformer id like to substitute an arc welder in place of a variac + transformer that some of my projects call for if i operate within the rated duty cycle will i run into any other issues my reasoning is that i dont want to be building transformers and pairing them with a variac without really knowing what im doing (im an engineer but not of the electrical persuasion) an arc welder might offer numerous safety features in a complete package that is (hopefully) much safer to interact with (relatively) ill also have some hard numbers to use as safe limits of operation the projects i have in mind are generally heating elements up through high current id probably get something that cant output more than 24v since im working with effectively unlimited amps,0

"do i need to add a stud theres a finished room in our basement i want to mount a 24"" tv to the wall using a mount with a ""somewhat articulated"" short (about 6"") arm the important thing is its not the kind of mount that keeps the tv ""snug up"" against the wall for unimportant reasons i need to install the mount smack dab between 2 studs well damn luckily that wall is open to the basement on the other side so i can easily do <whatever> do i need to install a complete stud (floor to ceiling) in that cavity between the 2 existing studs is there something else i can (safely) do to allow me to put the mount between the 2 studs i originally considered running a cross piece between the 2 studs but that didnt seem safe (not to mention i think the part of the mount that contacts the wall is around 6"" long (vertically) so id have to use multiple ""stacked"" cross pieces &#x200b; thanks for your time and advice",0

back again for advice - checklist of things that needs to be done im so disappointed i thought i got a great bargain but it turns out i just didnt know what to look for please chime in on anything you have any experience on i appreciate all opinions and thoughts 1 asbestos ducts in the attic; one duct is crushed or stepped on and a potential health hazard im hiring an asbestos removal company to remove the ducts and then hiring someone to install it one ducting company offered to do everything cheap but when he showed up and i asked him about the procedure and it seemed very shady no negative air pressure setup and he tried to say asbestos isnt dangerous i kicked him to the curb right away 2 attic insulation is the loose type and most likely has asbestos attached to it since everyone the warranty company sent out to fix that one duct needed to turn on the ac 3 furnace might be leaking gas still need to make appointment with gas company to come check 4 pinhole leak behind shower this is a funny story when i first moved in i remember thinking that my neighbors water their lawns a bit too much; id hear the sprinklers going off at all hours of the day one late night i took a shower and heard the sprinklers on after my shower it was still on in the middle fo the night when i had to use the restroom it was still on thats when i panicked and checked outside nope no sprinklers just a bit of wetness on the other side of my wall where the stucco meets the concrete all last week ive been dealing with the insurance company and warranty company 5 miscellaneous landscaping issues but ill deal with that later **now this is what im currently working on and need input/ideas/thoughts from all you wonderful diy-ers** 1 asbestos ducts - im hiring a company to do both removal and installation of ducting theyll contract out to a licensed asbestos removal company and then come in a few days later to install 2 in between duct removal and installation im renting an insulation vacuum and redoing the insulation i plan on getting the goggles and respirator; just checked that the respirator i have is not meant for asbestos will need some suggestions 3 ive semi-decided on stone vinyl planks with 55mm and 05mm top layer (20 mil or something like that) this would be for everywhere except bathrooms and maybe kitchen ive started drinking so i apologize and thank you beforehand,0

redoing plumbing- pipes vibrating when taps turned on so just had some plumbing redone for a sink and was everything was fine until recently whenever i turn any of the cold water taps in the house on slightly (o get a small dribble of water comes out) one of the pipes vibrates very loudly ive narrowed it down to the pipe causing it and it doesnt appear to be loose as its not connected to any walls the vibrating noise stops when i open the tap more the guides online doesnt say anything about vibration only when you turn the taps on slightly and most say things like a water hammer which i dont think it is or problems when you turn the water on too quickly any ideas,0

attic insulation diy questions hello im about to embark on my first diy project of insulating my attic i received some mixed opinions on quite a few things so i thought i would consult the experts of reddit to give the final say ive attached some photos and here are my questions: \- ive got recessed lighting throughout the attic (about 8 unites with 1000 sq feet) the lights seem to be ic rated when i look up the units online but they dont say anything about that on the actual unites when i examine them in the attic its not super easy to get up close to them ( very small ceilings) i guess im just paranoid my question is: should i still try to air seal these with a cover or will i be okay \- if i choose not to seal the recessed lights how should i go about marking where they are since ill have about 12 inches of insulation and theyll be covered also how would i go about marking other things like fans or electrical boxes is that something that is normally done \-theres a bunch cables scattered throughout as well as electrical boxes \- can the bathroom fan unit be covered with cellulose insulation as well i assume theres no fire hazard there thank you all,0

looking for some advice about a yale lock looking for a quick bit of advice about a lock firstly thanks for taking the time to read this i know its going to be difficult to diagnose the problem without actually seeing it - but im just looking for a bit of advice i have a yale lock on my front door - about 4-5 years old and i noticed recently the handle (on the inside of the house) is a little loose nothing major - maybe 3/4mm give all around i can wiggle it a bit - maybe i only just noticed but it seemed quite tight before it doesnt feel not secure - but it feels a little loose ive looked up the problem but all the advice is a little vague secondly on the outside - where i put the key in there is maybe another 3/4mm of turn before i feel any resistance to indicate the mechanism is kicking into action i dont notice this before - but maybe i just wasnt paying attention couple of questions - is this a worry should i call someone out to take a look at the lock im going away next month and someone is coming over every day with a key and dont want it to break on them secondly - is this something i can fix myself im fairly diy savvy i think is this just a case of removing the lock and tightening some screws any advice would be great - but i would totally understand if the only advice is get a professional to take a look thanks,0

advice on laying a floor over concrete a little over a year ago i started looking into converting our garage into a workshop the walls are single breeze blocks and the floor was unsealed concrete but unfortunately after sealing the floor life got in the way and the project was shelved fast forward to now and im eager to get the job done especially before the cold / damp really kicks in this year i work as a cabinet maker so have a fair understanding of tools / wood but apart from putting up a small stud wall a few years back ive never done any constructional work i figured id start on the floor as its likely the easiest part then move onto the walls from there my goal is pretty much to copy what this guy has done [here](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchv=dr8sqpguwzm) - 2x4s laid across the floor fill the gaps with some insulation slap a vapour barrier down over the top and cover the whole thing with 18mm sheets leaving ~10mm around each edge my main questions here are: 1 how should i secure the shims / boards to the floor he says in the comments something about spaghetti screws but i cant seem to find that outside of australia 2 he puts plastic under the shims which makes sense but then if you screw through that wont the screw break the seal 3 he also fills the gaps between the shims with what seems like [sikaflex](https://wwwuksealantscouk/sikaflex-ebt-adhesive-sealant-fillerhtml) although im guessing at which type exactly im going to have lathes / bandsaws running on parts of the floor so im thinking itd definitely needed in some places but doing the whole floor with it would cost a fortune any other suggestions 4 anything else ive missed or any other advice greatly appreciated,0

need help/advice on retaining wall project our home is build on about 5-6 feel hill taller than our neighbors behind us when i bought my house the property behind us had tall trees and foliage to sock in our yard with shade green and just peace recently the neighbor cut down all the trees and wants to build another house behind us this really screwed us because my yard sharply drops off about 1-2 foot from our actual property line in some areas and the top of our fence is only about 4 ft from the yard level where the yard is ive gotten a few quotes and having a professional do a retaining wall to raise our property so we can actually put a normal size fence up is too expensive i am going to have to do this myself terrifying but also after watching youtube i feel like i could do it i just have a few specific questions that i was wondering if anyone can help with there are already stones that are relatively flat that come up about 1-2 ft from the previous owners of the house that is on our property line the current fence is 1-2 ft in front of that so the goal would be to build that wall up fill it with dirt and put a new fence where we get all our land and fence height all the videos ive seen talk about digging your base and setting gravel/blocks at the bottom about ~9 under ground level my neighbor said that he thought they did that with these stones but i have no real way of checking 1) how can someone check previous stones to see if its a good base to build a wall on top of i was just gonna dig in front of it and see if it laid properly 2) if its a good base would it be better to build the wall on top of that (would definitely be easier) or is it always best practice to rip up old stone and start fresh 3) if i have to start fresh how on earth am i supposed to get the original stones out jackhammer 4) if i use the original base what can i do to make my first level of stone secure and level i was thinking of mortaring the first blocks on the stone and putting drain pipes in any help would be appreciated edit: some guys at church were saying that since my stone base is pretty stable (i think) i can just mortar the first level of blocks to the stone and make sure that the first row is level id make sure to put drain tubes throughout and am planning on putting a drain pipe at the base of 6 of gravel behind the wall drainage shouldnt be a problem thoughts from handy men and women who know this stuff more than me,0

"looking for cement board vs membrane advice for tiling over wood subfloor on top of my fired contractors screwed up attempt good morning i have an old ass house built in 1932 and im wanting to tile the floor of what will become the mud room hired a guy who seemed legit and claimed plenty of experience w/tiling i have since learned otherwise and let him go unfortunately i was dumb enough that it took him fucking up half the tile job for me to figure things out so dear diyers of reddit now ive got some questions this is all happening on a wood floor on wood joists : diagonal lumber sub floor with plywood over the top the real issue is that the floor had/has linoleum over the plywood about a 2/3s of which was removed when asbestos mastic was discovered the whole floor was then covered in an encapsulate and then half-assed leveled by my former contractor the floor is lumpy and saggy as we all get to be when were almost 100 years old squeaks like hell when you walk around so theres obvious movement happening my plan is to rip out the shitty tile scrape the floor down a bit *correctly* pour on leveler and then do the tile im fine with a membrane solution like ditra or a traditional durock product that being said the 1/8"" thickness of ditra and the ease of installation make it seem like a better choice even at the higher price but im concerned about whether it will be the strongest option considering the age and condition of the floor in general durock gets screwed into the subfloor so i think it may be better able to resist the flexing that im sure will still be present even after the leveler is applied any advice thanks [https://wwwschlutercom/schluter-us/en\_us/membranes/uncoupling-%28ditra%29/c/m-u](https://wwwschlutercom/schluter-us/en_us/membranes/uncoupling-%28ditra%29/c/m-u) [https://wwwusgcom/content/dam/usg\_marketing\_communications/united\_states/product\_promotional\_materials/finished\_assets/durock-cement-underlayment-board-submittal-en-cb250pdf](https://wwwusgcom/content/dam/usg_marketing_communications/united_states/product_promotional_materials/finished_assets/durock-cement-underlayment-board-submittal-en-cb250pdf)",0

can anyone suggest a diy fix for my wheelchair recently i heard a pop when i transferred over into my wheelchair when i took my seat cushion off my chair i saw the following: https://iimgurcom/t6ajqexpng https://iimgurcom/nesyodvpng https://iimgurcom/vze14xvpng the pop i heard was the screw in the far left hole there snapping apparently the first two screws on the right had already previously snapped at some point and i never noticed; it could have happened days ago weeks ago or even months ago for all i know the little bars with the holes in them are what hold the canvas of my seat to the frame the wheelchair as you can see without those front two screws one of the bars has been bent inward from my continuing the use the seat without knowing this had happened the screws snapped down inside of their screw holes i dont own any power tools so i cant drill the screws out or anything like that i am also quite poor so i cant afford to pay someone else to do it the chair is about half a decade out of warranty as well so i cant afford to have it repaired and i definitely cant afford to get a new wheelchair can anyone suggest something that isnt prohibitively expensive i could do to keep using my wheelchair thanks edit: thanks for all the suggestions and offers of assistance i ordered some steel zip ties and some hose clamps to try out those should be good enough until i find a more permanent solution thanks again,0

tell me if im crazy (woodworking wedding table diy) i want farmhouse tables for my wedding but theyre pricey to rent i found [this tutorial](https://youtube/85wibngnlvk) for a faux farmhouse tabletop to place over a folding table i was thinking i could make these 12 ft long & slip them on a 6ft or 8ft folding table with smaller blocks of 1x3 underneath to frame the smaller table so the top wouldnt slide around am i insane to think this would work would the 3ft overhang on the end cause the tabletop to tip if someone leaned on it if i made them from inexpensive pine would i have to worry about warping in such a long project are there questions im not even asking that i should be edit: the folding tables would be rented so i wouldnt have the opportunity to permenantly attach it i was thinking i could attach a piece of wood to the kind of cleats underneath to swivel under the edges of the folding table to hold it in place,0

not sure if water is off upstairs i have a place that should be a shower but currently the pipes are just capped off i want to install a shower valve there so i would need to cut the caps off and then solder in the valve before doing that i figure i need to turn off the water so i went downstairs and found what i assume is the valve in my boiler room i closed it then waited a while then to check i turned on my faucet in the kitchen water is still coming out of the faucet albeit significantly reduced rate not quote a trickle but close however i cant turn the value anymore than its already turned so i cant close it any more im worried that if i try to cut the caps off those pipes upstairs a little water will still be flowing in them and then ill be stuck with water spilling into my walls since i wont be able to solder anything with water coming out of the pipe what should i do here,0

how do i get the bottom of my deck stairs (stringers) out of standing water ive got a back deck with wooden stairs coming down onto the driveway the whole area is asphalt (afaik) the problem is the bottom of the stringers are sitting in a little valley where water collects in the rainy winters the stringers were so rotted the the entire bottom step broke off so im about to put in new stringers but i havent done a lot of this type of work what are my options to keep the stringers (and adjoining posts) high and dry i could try to re-grade that area but im not sure how that would go just forward of the little gulley the stringers are sitting in the ground levels off so theres nowhere obvious for the water to be directed could the stringers sit on top of a masonry brick product of some sort thats lifts them a few inches would i just trim the bottom of the stringers by the height of the masonry alternatively could i mix up some cement and fill in the valley pictures are posted here: any thoughts greatly appreciated thanks,0

custom shower pan issues alright so we need a custom size shower pan and have the intention of pouring a custom one with mortar i know i need a ratio of 5 part sand to 1 part concrete but also understanding the commercial quikrete sand/concrete 60lb bag is a 3:1 the main issue: pan is going on a concrete floor in a basement we had the pipes put into the floor and everything is already sealed and concrete has been poured over the top but it was done wrong and our show drain is now level with the basement floor not elevated to allow space for the first pour is it best to: a) do the first pour and narrow it down feather thin to the drain use additional specified epoxies and hardeners from the manufacturer and continue on with the membrane and second pour b) do the first pour but leave a few inches around the drain itself to avoid the feather thin mortar fill said area with caulk/epoxy under the shower membrane ive looked at shower systems too but same issue i cant find any special part to partially extend the pvc drain up and allow the needed clearance need to know what would be best to have under all those layers so i dont have a shift underneath that ruptures my shower membrane or causes total collapse on my tile floors once finished,0

"need help making modifications to a temporary window in my apartment (details inside) long story short my window broke several months ago due to construction my landlord has been doing instead of owning up to it and fixing it he made everything complicated by making up his own version of events and now were going through a lot of court related stuff to try and get someone to order him to fix it ive prefaced by typing that out so you can understand that the window was broken the inner pane was broken and the outer pane was cracked all kinds of noise was leaking through the cracked/broken window but it wasnt too bad you couldnt hear much from outside when there was noise on the inside this week my landlord finally got someone to come out and take a look they removed the window completely ""while waiting on a new window to come in"" and said it would be several weeks until they could come and install to hold me off in the meantime the guy put a temporary window (just a board of plastic it seems) and jammed it in there and held it in place using foam tubes the problem is this board of plastic is 10x worse than the cracked window you might as well have no board at all the noise just jumps out from the inside i need some tips if possible to insulate or jam the space between the plastic board (window) and the frame there is a space there about 1-15 inch thick picture: https://iimgurcom/aaz7se6jpg ive attached a picture to help you see the window ive taped around the sides just in case there were any gaps leaking sound to the outside it helped a tiny bit but tape isnt going to block out anything as we all know i dont mind completely blocking or putting something up that would prevent me from using the window itself i can use the one right next to it which is intact so guys are there any cheap options to help me retain some privacy using this temporary window ive thought about going out and buying acoustic panels/foam but i have no idea how good those things are and people keep complaining thanks for any help or tips in advance",0

help with my rolling gaming station and temperatures so ive been sitting on this idea for a year or two now and now that my son is getting a little older and much more interested in video games (only a *little* help from me) id like to bring this idea to fruition so i bought this [rolling a little shelf space in it drilled out some holes in the back for cables to come through to the top for monitor and whatnot and i put my xbox inside the cabinet (you can laugh) thinking nothing was wrong hour or two later it over heated who wouldve thought were tight on space in the house so wherever me or my son wants to log some time on the consoles i roll the cart to and from and plug the power strip in and were good to go anyway the cabinet itself is a little too tall to bring the monitor to eye level which isnt the biggest deal and not my main concern (im hoping i can mount the monitor on some type of arm to bring it down and in front of the cabinet for comfortability but i have yet to find such an arm/mount that clamps or mounts to a surface and the monitor/tv) further to create less clutter and cables all over the place id really like to fashion some way to keep the consoles *inside* the cabinet even with the doors open it gets to an uncomfortable temperature ive never done anything like this but i also dont want to cut holes and mount some pc fans and do all of the wiring if it wont matter in the long run/wont work curious to see if anyone has done anything like this or could offer some ideas thanks in advance edit: thank you all for the help now that the cooling issue is resolved does anyone have any idea for a monitor arm that swivels extends and lowers sorry if that sounds incorrect i just dont know the proper term for what it would be similar to the wall mounts with a swivel/bend arm for tvs,0

pergola wall support issue im currently underway building a pergola against our home were based in germany and the house was built 3 years ago to the highest insulation standard possible (kw55) this build standard means a massive amout of insulation and unfortunately a massive unforseen block of insulation above the standard german window roll shutter housing the wall where i need to glue in bolts for the pergola support is for the most part above 2 doors this presents the issue that all the outer bolts will go into the following wall materials (in this order): 1 3cm outer render 2 7cm hard insulation 3 4cm of the door lintel hard concrete of 13 support bolts only the center 5 go into solid wall the rest are equally over the 2 doors heres a picture of one side this is a mirror of the other door &#x200b; https://ireddit/fvv1q3w050p31png my issue is that all the outer bolts will have to go into the formentioned insulation and lintel im concerned that if i go ahead with attaching the support ill eventually end up with a very broken wall * i cant move the pergola support upwards * i cant lengthen the support does anyone have any idea how i might stabalise this below is a stock photo of the pergola im diying: https://ireddit/pnwhvjwm40p31jpg just imagine the above but placed centrally between 2 equally seperated doorways thanks in advance,0

how to water proof plywood/foam mannequin without sacrificing flexibility i purchased a weird homemade mannequin off craigslist (pictured [here] and i want to use it as a halloween decoration outside but it isnt exactly weatherproof everywhere except for the head is made of plywood and foam what would be the best way to make it suitable for outdoor use i was considering just wrapping up all the parts in rain ponchos and duct tape would that be enough the arms and legs are articulated at the elbow and shoulder id prefer to let those parts still move if possible appearance does not really matter as itll be covered up with clothes,0
"questions about birch plywood follow up question to my post the other day about interior plywood walls: i am cladding my walls and ceilings in my music studio with plywood and found out that it wouldnt be that much more to use 1/2 inch birch rather than radiata pine i know birch doesnt take stains well whats the best way to finish it tung oil appeals to me because of its waterproofing properties (and its slightly more ""green"") ive read that it makes birch look ""flat"" and less appealing ive read that the birch veneer is very thin so it doesnt hold up to sanding very well whats the best way for a nice satin finish",0

possible replacements for shower tile floor i purchased a house recently and it has a lovely bathroom but the shower floor is the worst when we purchased it the grout was white and brown and after scrubbing im still not sure which is the original color i dont like trying to clean it i also dont enjoy the feeling of time under my feet horrible shower - i am looking to fix it up and have researched some options i was considering a few options: 1 take out the tile and replace it with an acrylic pan from what i understand the pan has a lip that goes under the wall tile this would require me tearing tiles off the walls 2 clean the tiles and reseal them i would still have to stand on the tiles i prefer option one but dont want to rip out the walls is there a way either put a pan on top of the existing floor i imagine it would impossible to stop water going between the existing floor and the pan which would cause problems or is there another possible solution that i am missing thanks,0

bathroom remodeling questions [concrete/mortar design] questions: what is the best and lowest cost method of obtaining a mortar or concrete surface on my walls/ceiling in my bathroom and how do i best go about colorizing it to look similar [to this](http://modernmasterscafecom/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/2-metallic-plaster-wall-finish-for-bedroomjpg) im remodeling our bathroom and im wanting our walls/ceiling to be covered with either a type of mortar/cement for aesthetics (such as brush strokes and texture design) the questions are about how to do this properly with proper moisture protection and how to best go about colorizing the surface of mortar or concrete (stain vs dye etc) currently were gutting it out to the studs regarding the construction process i think we need to attach plywood to all surfaces seal the plywood place mortar for cement boards place cement boards place concrete/mortar allow cure time stain seal with this all being a costly process is there an easier or cheaper way to obtain the structural support of the material while sticking with either concrete or mortar im avoiding plaster since it chips too easily regarding the colorizing i understand the options to mostly be stain or dye i only find instructions about it for concrete but would the same processes also work for mortar while dye appears the easiest im more wanting the aesthetics of stain everything seems relatively easy for stain up until where i consider how to neutralize the acid all instructions state to wash it off which is more easily said than done when working indoors with plywood flooring i saw [this product](https://youtube/1gwnp_b-dhw) that says there is no acid which then im not sure how its actually staining the concrete they go directly from staining to sealing can anyone make sense of that,0

tricky landscaping issue with townhouse hello i have a conundrum of what i should do landscaping-wise on a tricky spot in front of my house i live in a row of townhouses built in 1986 the developers decided to build on a hill and step the foundations down between every other unit or so which puts my foundation a little of a foot above my neighbors im redoing the front landscaping and discovered that previous owners were very careless [imgur they built a pseudo retaining wall up against the neighbors wall extending well above their foundation making a nice dark moist area ideal for termites - the wood i pulled out was riddled with termite damage and from the images above you can see the damage to the neighbors trim and i imagine it continues into her house my question is how should i go about landscaping in this area i imagine i need an honest retaining wall of some sort but am unsure how to proceed because of the neighbors property,0

help building a collapsible sleeping platform for the back of my car hey there i couldnt find any project that matched what i have in mind on google so i thought id drop my idea here to see what you guys made of it basically i want a sleeping platform -- essentially just a low table -- to cover the back of my car with a board resting on that and the back of the folded down seats together forming a place to put a mattress ideally i would build it in two parts one for each side of the car so i can choose whether i want to use the entire back of the car or whether i want it for storage the final criterion that i want is that it should be collapsible and able to be stored compactly as well as assembled and disassembled quickly &#x200b; what i was thinking was build it as two tables one for each side of the car the tables would be made of a plywood (or similar) sheet with pvc pipe table caps screwed into the underside i would then cut pvc pipe to the right length and that would slot into the table caps to make the legs if pvc isnt going to be robust enough i could look at using steel pipe and flanges &#x200b; any thoughts,0

can any of this deck be salvaged so my house had a deck when we moved in it was obviously split into two parts: the original part built by the contractor and a cheap addition added by one of the previous owners the addition put in by the previous owners is a death trap and is coming down regardless of what happens to the rest of it what i dont know is if any of the original deck joists or posts can be salvaged or not the joists all look fine but the posts have splits of varying severity running along the grain my hope was that i could just replace the rails and the decking boards but i doubt thats the right thing to do heres a link to photos of the deck: i have three primary questions: 1 can any of this deck be saved 2 assuming i have to tear it all down do i even rip off the ledger board and replace that 3 if i opt to build a smaller deck (likely) it will not run the entire length of the existing ledger board how do i handle that do i need to add siding back to cover where the board used to be or is there another way to handle it,0

help making this utility sink usable its obvious this is bigger than me plug back in thanks everybody ~~in my basement laundry room we have a utility sink that was set up with only cold water and a drain that just basically let the water flow into a rusted floor drain~~ ~~since then ive cobbled together a solution for hot water and put some bilge tubing in to get it to drain better but theres leakage at multiple spots unfortunately i dont know the terms for the place where im draining the water so google-fu is not helping me too much~~ ~~heres a gallery of pictures to see what im talking about~~ ~~a couple problems: 1) the sink is 4-5 feet from where it eventually drains into the main pipe 2) the tubing it drains into kind of needs to be flexible so that it can get around a refrigerator we are putting next to it and squeeze behind the washing machine (seen in the pictures) 3) theres leakage at both ends because (surprise surprise) shoving bilge tubing into the hole doesnt magically make a water tight seal 4) do i need to find a way to elevate the drain tubing so it feeds downward into its final destination if so im in trouble because the bottom of the sink is fairly low and quite deep and the drain is probably 4-6 inches up not a lot of wiggle room 5) finally i have no idea what that yellow plug in the last picture is called and i feel like knowing that alone would send me on a wonderful internet journey of answering questions~~ ~~the idea is to be able to use the sink as part of a make-shift kitchenette it wont be cute but hopefully youll be able to wash dishes in it~~ ~~thanks for reading let me know if you have any ideas or know what that blasted plug is called~~,0

buckling floors during humid days help just bought a house in vermont where it can get quite humid in the summer months the previous owners redid the basement and turned it into a nice master bedroom the only problem they didnt install the bamboo wood floors correctly they installed them so tight to the walls there is no room for them to expand during the humid weather and they buckled and split even with a dehumidifier running nonstop i would like to replace the floors and not ever have to worry about them buckling again thoughts on what type of material would be best to last ontop of the concrete that is underneath the bamboo slate something that will absorb the moisture its roughly 400sqft were not rolling in money and will probably do it ourselves so nothing too high end thanks for your input and suggestions,0

freestanding patio roof advice hey longtime lurker here i just closed on a house that has brick veneer siding i was thinking of building a freestanding patio roof over an existing concrete patio since im not comfortable with attaching a ledger to the veneer even with those fancy bvlz connectors my question is can i build the patio roof freestanding and butt the roof up against the house or would it shift due to the elements and tear caulking off if so whats the closest i can get that patio roof to the house so it gives the appearance that the roof is attached to the house and allow water run off im in georgia and it seldom snows here like once every four years so i dont figure snow is a huge factor in the construction if this is a terrible idea i may just lay down concrete away from the house and build the free standing patio roof that way to complete mitigate my problem either way works if possible but the former is much more aesthetically pleasing to my wifes eyes thanks in advance,0

"repairing old style drywall ive recently opened up a wall in my house but im stuck on how to go about re-drywalling it my problem is that the drywall doesnt seem to be the standard thickness its like there is an under layer of drywall (pieces are 16"" tall and maybe 4 ft wide or so) and a top layer of this hard substance which is about the same thickness as the underlying drywall total thickness ranges from about 3/4"" to 1"" has anyone seen this before and have any suggestions i found a thread on an old message board with what sound like the same thing ( [https://wwwgaragejournalcom/forum/showthreadphpt=84330](https://wwwgaragejournalcom/forum/showthreadphpt=84330) ) but there dont seem to be any discussions related to patching/fixing it was thinking maybe attaching small plywood spacers onto the studs and then regular drywall on top of it and patch/sand down as needed since the thickness varies https://ireddit/7obrq7narmo31jpg https://ireddit/ddqatql6rmo31jpg",0

sistering joists or bridging flooring deflection question i am preparing to lay tile in my 1930s constructed home the subfloor is structural planking with 5/8 nominal osb on top i plan on laying ditra and then tiling the entire first floor i have recently discovered that the living room joist span is on the edge of too far for l/360 deflection all other areas of the house are properly supported underneath with beams and the correct distances should i be doing sistering on the existing 2x10s or bridging with 2x10 sections between the joists the joists are in good shape not broken at all minimal knots old wood so probably better than most wood available at big box stores these days the wood is dry and not much creaking or squeaking just a bit bouncier than i would like and i want to be sure my tiles dont pop back off after all this work anyone have experience with or info on standard practices for correcting deflection without installing a beam what is the best way to lessen the bouncing thanks,0

4 diy playstation 4 wall mount i recently took a trip to ikea and came across some wall hooks that work perfectly for a diy ps4 wall mount idea i came up with a long time ago [https://wwwikeacom/gb/en/p/baengbula-hook-black-20411543/](https://wwwikeacom/gb/en/p/baengbula-hook-black-20411543/) items needed: x2 pack of hooks (150 each) pack of adhesive felt pads (100) basic tools & fixings &#x200b; heres how it turned out &#x200b; https://ireddit/6bbvfc7x5mo31jpg &#x200b; https://ireddit/u6ww63e16mo31jpg i used 4 wall hooks and screwed them to the wall as equally as possible to the shape of the ps4 with the hook bodies fitting flush against the ps4 casing almost as if to hold it tight after inserting the ps4 into the hook bodies the slightly larger end caps then screw on separately and clamp the ps4 in position by grabbing into the guttering that surrounds the ps4 casing this allows you to slide the ps4 in and out of the hooks left and right if needed but wont allow the ps4 to be pulled forwards the towel hooks are slightly longer than they need to be so the ps4 does sit a little bit loose so i just doubled up some self adhesive felt pads (for chair legs) to pack of the ps4 from the wall which has made it fit nice and snug enjoy,0

installing a shelf where i cant anchor the back to preface this i have a very old house (built around 1910) i am trying to install a shelf in the kitchen and the wall i want to hang it on is concrete or bricks covered in plaster it sounds easy right but i cant seem to drill more than half an inch into the wall i have a combination hammer drill and i have used masonry bits and metal bits (i thought i was hitting some rebar in the wall) but all i am doing is chewing up the wall and making the hole wider i have tried drilling at different points on the wall (vertically and horizontally across) but i keep getting stuck at the same depth i live in a semi and this is the shared wall so i dont want to get to heavy duty with a stronger hammer drill and go through it so my plan is to anchor the shelf on the ends one end has a wood cabinet and the other is the same brick/cement but i seem to be able to drill through it the shelf is 6 feet long my questions are: 1) is this a terrible idea/have very poor strength and support 2) would a hardwood vs softwood provide better support 3) can i still make this a floating shelf or do i need to make sure there is more support under the shelf as well &#x200b; thanks reddit,0

hated our banister so decided a change was necessary this started off with my wife complaining that she hated the existing banister because it looked ugly i decided that rather than spending money on getting a new one id try take the project on myself i started by stripping the paint off i used a heat gun for the pieces that i could remove from the fittings and for the posts and then used chemical paint remover on the parts of the staircase i couldnt take off this left the wood looking really old and stained so i was initially considering just painting it a different colour i figured id sand it down first though to get it a bit smoother i sanded it all down with the combined efforts of a random orbital sander and a detail sander this left the wood looking clean and new thats when my wife and i decided on trying out the natural wood look but i wanted to do something to protect the wood i looked into a variety of finishing products including different oils lacquers and varnishes and considered different colours too but in the end we wanted it well protected but as close to the natural colour as possible i settled on an oil based varnish which then meant applying four coats over the entire banister which took a while as i was only able to do it around my work and social schedule its taken a while to get here but it is finally done and now i think i feel brave enough to take on a new project in the house,0

painting dresser and i need advice i only painted furniture once a few years ago i painted a small nightstand with just water-based primer and latex paint it came out alright but the nightstand was a bit sticky i left someone on my nightstand a few hours later when i remove it it was slightly sticky i am not sure if this is because i used way too much paint or painted too early between layers anyways im looking to paint my dresser its some sort of laminated mdf or engineered wood i already sanded it i was looking for a sheen that is eggshell or satin i was hoping it might be enough to use what i already have at home white latex satin paint white latex flat paint white acrylic latex paint + primer in one zinsser primer minwax water-based polycrylic satin finish minwax water-based polycrylic satin matte finish tons of brushes and rollers so far i was planning to just prime it and then afterward paint it so a couple of questions 1 - how many layers of primer are necessary 2 - will latex paint and water-based primer be good enough for this or do i need to get oil 3 - do i need to use polycrylic or will it be fine without it 4 - if i use polycrylic and if in the future i want to touch up some parts will i have to remove the polycrylic or can i just paint over and use polycrylic again over it 5- if i should use polycrillic should i use flat paint with satin polycrylic or satin paint with satin polycrylic or satin paint with matte polycrylic i wasnt sure if by using satin paint and satin polycrylic the results will be too glossy for my taste 6 - how do i avoid painted furniture feeling sticky is it sticky because of latex paint meaning oil paint doesnt cause stickiness or does stickiness come from applying it wrong also any other advice you can give me will be helpful also thanks,0

sand floor leveling compound my wife and i are about to purchase our first house and have a quick question the house is quite old (built in 1894) and some of the joists in the kitchen have sagged over time we had an inspection and the inspector wasnt concerned at all about it he mentioned that it likely settled a while ago one thing he did mention was that the previous owner had attempted to level the floors by pouring leveling compound directly on the original wood floors we were curious if it would be possible/feasible to sand this off using a floor sander in order to salvage the original flooring any input would be greatly appreciated,0

wood hot tub with epoxy i was planning on building one and i was wondering if its viable to make a hot tub but instead of using jointers for the staves youd use epoxy jointers for the wood is obviously good because as the wood absorbs water itll expand and form a seal on its own but i just really really dont want to deal with that for all the staves and epoxy itself forms a watertight seal so i feel that just painting it in epoxy should be enough obviously the floor and the staves would be joined by a dado joint and the entire thing would be held together via steel bands or cable i was also thinking of using 4 inch staves to give a good polygon look the tub itself will be 4 feet in diameter are there any obvious flaws im missing,0

levelling out a subfloor hi all i could really do with some advice on this one im going to be installing laminate flooring in our living room next week and theres a pronounced 2mm lip between the front halfs plank subfloor and the concrete subfloor in the back half of the room (they were originally two separate rooms that got knocked through) my original intention was to lay a plywood base over the wooden subfloor to bring it level with the concrete but 2mm plywood seems to be hard to get hold of in large enough sheets (presumably because it breaks up too easily) my two options now are to either lay different thicknesses of underlayment to bring the floor level or to lay 3mm hardboard and sand a chamfer to the lip to at least reduce the difference in height am i missing a third option,0

anti-diy: when / how to best remove fresh silicon joints to let a professional handle this i stupidly decided to renew the silicon joints in my bathroom during the weekend and removing them already proved more of a problem than i thought (theyre ancient and there are the opposites of best practices on the layer below everywhere) even more stupidly i still decided to redo them tonight - cant make things worse than before right wrong whats the best way to remove the freshly placed silicon and when is it best to do so removing it when completely fresh didnt work well (no chemical help available besides usual household chemicals and solvents) - is there an ideal point when its are half-cured and i can peel it off easily can i somehow weaken them right now so they cure wrong otherwise someone should probably check on the rest anyway and maybe my landlord and i can co 50/50 on the silicon stuff,0

"patio sub base and other specs - i dont want to get screwed again hi all tl;dr: how deep should a patio subbase be all research online says 150mm (6"") my builders are saying as little as 15-20mm (06"" - 079"") &#x200b; detail: i had a patio laid by cowboys years ago and rain water then damaged the sandstone house at the base now after a lot (a lot) of research ive found a decent business in the area to replace it all the research online says the patio needs to have a sub base of 150mm (6"") and be 150mm below the damp course i asked the builders about that and they said no way and said digging out 300mm (12"") would be a mammoth task (theres also an old tarmac path underneath theyd have to dig through doing this) and instead what they do is dig a 15-20mm (06"" - 079"") subbase &#x200b; they said a 150mm subbase would be for cars or even lorries and that for foot traffic only 15mm-20mm is fine is that right ive dug 5 test holes and the ground underneath is either dense rocky clay at the front and side of the house or the red/black brick hardcore the cowboys put in at the back of the house there is more ground to fill at the back because it drops away into the garden so they used a lot of this red crushed brick material to build it up level &#x200b; while im asking: they also want to put the patio only 50mm (2"") below the damp course but to compensate place it 100mm (4"") away from the wall with gravel in the gap to drain water away - plus a gentle slope away from the house for drainage &#x200b; does all this sound right after spending thousands repairing the brickwork i really dont want to go through that again",0

"shower pan replacement hey all was looking for some input as i am preparing to replace my shower pan i do not want to re-tile my whole shower; i want this to be as minimally invasive as possible i have done the research and my shower wall tile is extremely common so it will be very easy to match it once i demo the floor / pan and knock out the bottom two rows of tiles or whatever is necessary to get the pan out my basic plan is as follows: 1 knock out my shower floor tile as well as the first two rows or so of tile up the wall (should give me almost 8 inches of clearance) 2 remove the old shower pan 3 make sure my subfloor is level 4 apply thinset mortar then place my prefab shower pan (something like schluter kerdi cut to size) centered around the drain hole 5 apply waterproof membrane-- either a sheet membrane like kerdi or noble or a liquid membrane like redguard 6 apply mortar as i lay the tile is that the basic flow i should be keeping in mind or am i missing something big my other questions are as follows: * should i anticipate having to replace the drain or is it possible i can sort of ""work around"" the current drain and keep it in place if i have to replace do you have any cheap recommendations for kits i should look into * what other major hurdles should i anticipate any particular resources you would say are ""must-watch"" or ""must-read"" i am trying to keep this on as low of a budget as possible but i do think it is worth spending the extra money on a prefab pan so i can eliminate some potential issues related to bad pitch poor drainage etc i understand that can still happen but i want to minimize the likelihood of that i appreciate any input you can give thanks in advance",0

updated a pair of vintage westnofa siesta chairs [album i found these two westnofa siesta chairs with a matching footstool on craigslist for $80 i did some looking online and found that new canvas and laces from the [manufacturer](https://centuryhouseinccom/product/siesta-chair-replacement-canvas-cord-kit/) are nearly $400 per chair add the classic [siesta leather cushions](https://centuryhouseinccom/product/siesta-classic-high-back-chair-replacement-cushions/cat=697) at another $1600-1900 each aaaaaand thats a nope from me plan b i really liked the idea of a leather element to the chair so i decided to replace the canvas portion with leather i purchased two sides of water buffalo leather from tandy leather (along with 130 brass grommets the grommet tool and a punch kit) total cost from tandy: $275-ish then another $15 at home depot for paracord i already had the stain and topcoat from a previous project so im counting that as free which brings me to a grand total of $370 for two beautiful chairs and a stool way cheaper than the $5k+ for original parts i was originally planning to diy a linen cushion similar to the ones that originally come on the chair and i may still do so in the future but for now i just have a down pillow on the seat and a faux-sheepskin over the back its surprisingly comfortable that way the leather has more give to it than the canvas did so there is less need for cushioning this was my first time working with leather i learned a lot there are certainly flaws but overall im really happy with the final result,0

part of self-leveling cement still soft after one day my wife and i put down self-leveling cement to level our living room floor after our foundation was repaired a year and a half ago we had structural engineers come out and give us the go ahead that movement had stopped so we want to put laminate flooring down we put down the slc on a clean and primed concrete subfloor now that the slc has cured we definitely have parts that need to be grinded down/filled in i knew it wasnt going to be perfect and i accept that but there is another area that has me more concerned the last bucket that we poured ended up curing white instead of the dark grey like the rest and after 20 hours while the rest of the slc job has hardened this last bucket is still soft you can walk on it without sinking in but you leave a footprint on the surface when you do it isnt deep just a cosmetic footprint and walking on it barefoot it definitely feels damp also when i tried to sweep up the broom actually ended up sanding down the soft surface and when that happens the white top layer reveals a grayer lower level that is more in-line with the coloring on the rest of the floor i tried my hand with sanding one section by hand with rough sand paper and it didnt take long to get to a lower level that wasnt soft (could tell by the sound of the sandpaper) i dont think i used extra water on this bucket if i did it wasnt much i am wondering if i just got a bad bag on that last pour that had the wrong ratio of cement/fibers etc at this point do i need to just sand up that bad bucket and start over or should i give it more time to see if it cures and dries out a little more,0

how can i fix skirting board to wall thats not straight and the tiles dont go far enough hi all looking for help how i can sort a problem with attaching skirting to drywall that is slightly not straight images here - weve had the bathroom tiled and it appears the tiles dont go near enough to the wall for the skirting to fit without a gap if i push the skirting towards the wall then it falls down a tony gap thats created because the tiles dont go close enough (second image) in this case there is both a gap at the tiles 5mm and also at the wall 15mm if i pull the skirting board off the wall a little so it is covering the tiles then there is an even bigger gap of around 20mm (first image) how can i try to minimise the gap so the skirting board looks better i cant do new drywall as its out the question and i dont think cutting tiles is an option either thanks edit: pictures added,0

re-grouting shower floor (pics included) hi all first-time diyer here our shower floor appears to be showing some crack/gaps in the grouting ive bought some re-grouting mix and was going to attempt filling/fixing it today however in drying it out with a hairdryer i realized im able to keep forcing droplets of water up and out of it leading me to think theres more water in there than i realize under the tiles my concern is as its in the shower floor is constantly wet is there a risk of water under the tiles causing greater damage would i be safe to apply the new grout to fill it up or should i be getting a professional in to take a look,0

"barn door dilemma -- sizing for logistical reasons we want to change out a traditional door for a barn door but the size is a bit odd the interior of the frame is 36 x 80ish but the trim takes it to 425 x 84 (approx) and due to the lack of space on either side of the door well probably need a double door the closest sized double barn doors ive seen at lowes and home depot are 42 x 84 the next two sizes are 48 x 80 \[too short\] and 60 x 84 \[wider than wed like\] this leads me to believe were probably going to need to get a little creative so far weve come up with two possible solutions: 1 use two 24 x 84 barn doors to make our own double door the hold up here is the price the best i can figure using two separate doors is going to basically double our cost even though doors sold as double doors arent really any more expensive ew 2 build our own door were fairly handy so its not a huge deal breaker we just arent completely sure where to start i would assume we buy a barn door hardware kit or the components of it (well cross that bridge if we need to) and then build our own door \[slab doors are apparently only available in 80 or 96\] i just dont know if theres a ""best"" material or blueprint for one the door is for a laundry room if that makes any difference to you im hoping someone has had a similar experience or has some advice theyd like to share honestly anything from where to buy pair of cheap doors to tips on building your own door would be appreciated thanks",0

"power surge killing the hvac motherboard i manage an older duplex where each unit has a separate breaker box fed by two independent 220v lines recently a squirrel nibbled some sort of wire and the two wires pushing 220v each combined to 440v and went through a single unit none of the breakers tripped but i had two surge protectors and an hvac motherboard blow out downstream on the affected circuit the power company explains this as a ""floating ground"" where an unintended ground after the breaker completed the circuit and pushed too much power into the circuit resulting in the surge is there any reason a homeowner couldnt install a sacrificial fuse right before the power supply to the hvac unit in such a way to prevent damage from any future surge or is this such a freak occurrence that it doesnt make sense any insight is appreciated",0

"another guy looking to do a diy wood fire pizza oven saw the ooni karu and other ooni products i loved the thought of having a larger than conventional oven as well as the high heat wood produces looking at a bunch of diy pizza ovens on youtube made me wonder whats the point of making it yourself if the oven is too small or you have to scrape out the embers to use it i mostly focused on the people who made them for very little money less than $200 as i would like to spend less than $150 if possible &#x200b; i looked up the ratios how the dome height should be 75% of the diameter of the inside of the oven the opening should be 63% but i didnt see anything on the width of the opening id like to do 18"" pizzas on occasion or long baguettes that are 18-20"" so id like my opening to be that wide so i was thinking about doing a 32"" diameter oven with a 24"" height 2016"" h x 20"" w opening (arched) if i want have the space to be able to do an 18"" pizza maybe the inside should be about 36 - 40"" instead &#x200b; the trade off i think is that the larger oven would take a longer time to heat so i might be less inclined to use it if it becomes a hassle to heat every time if i do more 10-16"" pizzas and 18"" baguettes i think 32"" would be fine &#x200b; so with that being said a few questions: 1 for anyone whos done this have you used it as often more or less than you had initially planned 2 what kinds of things have you found you cook more 3 what was the total amount you spent 4 what size oven did you decide to make 5 are you glad you went through with it 6 is there anything you would have done differently after the fact",0

how to time halloween lights when my outlet is only 1ft above the ground sorry for the super simple question- im a total dunce when it comes to electrical stuff and i just want to make sure im not going to fry my landlords circuits or anything if it starts raining just got some outdoor halloween lights and strung them up and realized that because they dont come with an on/off switch i have to just leave the plugs hanging out when im not using them which already seems ominous- so i figured id invest in a light timer but all of the outdoor timers say they need to be positioned vertically at least 2 ft above the ground and my outlet is only 1 foot above the floor of my balcony and because the timers themselves look a tad long i think when i plug the lights into them theyre going to be practically laying on the ground which i can tell wasnt the intended position whats the worst that could happen if i just use the light timer anyway- am i risking my landlords electrical system or merely risking ruining my own lights and also what are my options im on the second floor so i dont see standing water being an issue but i want to make sure im doing this right and not risking anything important thank you,0
getting ready to re-caulk tub and noticed this best fix this is a solid backer there is no grout the crack recently appeared and we are getting ready to re-caulk as you see the caulk is looking rough tub is 10ish years old so it is time looking at using [https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/ge-10-1-oz-white-silicone-2-plus-kitchen-and-bath-sealant-ge5070-12c/100070329](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/ge-10-1-oz-white-silicone-2-plus-kitchen-and-bath-sealant-ge5070-12c/100070329) to recaulk around the outside would we use the same to cover this crack up im worried about it causing issues &#x200b; picture of hairline crack that we are seeing &#x200b; its fairly long but not wide at all is silicone caulk the best way to handle this its white tile though the light in our bathroom is rather yellow :/ grout looks gross and that is why we are doing this im aware :) going to strip all the old caulk and put down the new caulk if there are any suggestions for the best caulk for my money i will take any advice,0

insulation you can mold/form i had a humming coming from my upright freezer which i located behind a removable panel after i removed it i found a build up of ice and piece of styrofoam insulation unfortunately removing the ice broke the insulation beyond that was the evaporator fan and more ice build up that i removed (which fixed the humming noise) heres the rub: ive contacted the manufacturer along with a couple suppliers but no one has that piece of insulation available and without it ice is forming pretty quick any ideas on something i could perhaps mold to the removable panel that would act as insulation thanks,0

led safety question from doing various google searches i understand that led lights are extremely safe bec of the incredibly low amount of heat they generate but can i assume there are still risks for example i once purchased a couple of strips of exposed leds from a dollar store they had an adhesive side and were designed to be attached to the back of a tv according to the box if i snaked one of these strips through a coloured straw and turned it on for a craft project would that be safe or would the near/direct contact eventually heat up the straw enough to melt it (ps not entirely sure if i chose the right flair feel free to change if its wrong),0

insulation for concert noise so i bought a new home which happens to be across the street from an outdoor concert amphitheater as a result on concert days the sound checks during the day with their intermittent bass and the actual concerts are driving me crazy as i cant get away from the bass thump inside my home i am hoping to hire a contractor to possibly insulate 1 or 2 rooms in house so i have somewhere to hide during the concert days online articles suggest adding an additional room inside my current room with rockwool insulation or mlv is this the best option do you think i will need to add another ceiling and floor layer as well how do i handle the windows in the room as i cant realistically wall them off the house is brand new construction for what its worth im willing to spend up to 20k if it means no sound will make it through to the insulated rooms help,0

"is it possible to make this cleaner/disinfectant by myself and does it really work ok i dont know if this is the correct sub to post this i searched a little but could not find something that would fit more since r/chemistry seems to be something more focused on the science itself and more professional area so please forgive me if this is not allowed here i have recently heard about [this product](https://wwwtreehuggercom/cleaning-organizing/force-nature-turns-tap-water-powerful-green-cleanerhtml) that claims to be an ""electrolyzed water"" ""an all-purpose cleaner and disinfectant thats as effective on glass as windex and as good as formula 409 and clorox clean up on oil and grease"" that ""contains two potent ingredients sodium hydroxide which is a suds-free detergent and grease-cutter found here in a concentration of 00000003% (although some major brands contain up to 5%) and hypochlorous acid which cleans and deodorizes as effectively as bleach"" made only by adding electricity to a solution composed of water salt and vinegar apparently they sell capsules with the mixture (just add it to tap water) and an electrolyzer (in which you put the solution) so considering that the article explicitly and directly cites these common ingredients (water salt vinegar and electricity) and that you can prepare/finish preparing the solution at home i think that would be possible to also make it but without buying it (even because i live in brazil and this product is not available here) is that possible and if it is what would be the concentration for each ingredient and how to add the electricity without causing an electrical short circuit (im not planning on inserting two wires in the wall power plug and putting it in a bowl with the mixture lol) also is there an ideal current to apply to it thanks in advance",0

help mounting monitor arm on brick so i recently got a big display tablet for drawing and since my desk is made of glass i thought of getting a wall monitor arm instead of a desk arm for which i would have to buy a new desk that could hold the weight we thought the wall was concrete (on the surface its just your regular white painted wall) but soon after we started drilling the white powder ended and red dust started coming out of the holes we tried mounting it with the regular plastic anchors that came with the set (we really dont know what were doing) and as we are tightening the screws we realized that not only was the wall brick but also that the screws are way too long and soon we hit a hollow space behind the brick layer itself the screw already has a tendency to come loose but the hollow space making it tip over is even worse we attempted to add a wooden board in front of the wall to make up for the hollow space and it seemed perfect until we tried putting some weight onto the arm and the top screw started to loosen (the wall also seems to be more rigid on the lower portion) since the arm has to be able to come across the desk safely is there ever going to be a way that the wall will hold the weight the display is 16 lbs plus the adapter and the arm itself any clarifications or suggestions would be aprecciated,0

making a large deep set of drawers cant seem to find hardware that has deep enough travel suggestions im making some drawers for my tiny apartment big enough to slide under my bed i have 52 inches of depth and approx 42 inches of travel before the drawers will run into the wall but the longest drawer hardware (called drawer slides) that i can find is 28 inches and some of those are ridiculously expensive like $130 a pair (im going to need 4 pairs) so 2 questions: 1) can i find hardware that will actually get closer to my desired 42 inches 2) is there alternative hardware that maybe isnt as expensive that is better for this application thanks,0

joint tape for drywall so ive been remodeling my bathroom for the first time and went through installing new drywall and taping and mudding its been about 2 weeks (i can only work on it 1 day a week currently) and my wife told me the ceiling joints are already cracking the home is 1960s and im not concerned about the trusses moving a bunch nor am i concerned with the way i installed the drywall but what i am now finding out is that fiber tape (which i used) is not recommended to use on drywall joints unless youre using hot mud or specific compound but instead paper tape in almost all cases long story short i used it along with a bucket of usg lightweight mud i feel like an idiot and im wondering do i rip out all the mud and tape that i just did 2 weeks ago and redo with paper throughout the whole bathroom and whats the best way if so (sanding scoring and peeling etc) im kind of mad at myself for not researching that part first but my walls are currently ready for paint and id like to tackle this now if need be before i go any further any advice would be welcomed,0

ethernet run from basement to first floor folks - i am finishing my basement and as part of this wanted to do a home run of ethernet to the av rack from upstairs office i found a jack through which the verizon cable comes when i followed it downstairs it came through the basement so i thought i could use this hole without drilling a new one however on trying i found that the wire is too thick to enter this so i had to make another hole from the basement right next to it after several unsuccessful tried using drill bits upto a 1/2 inch i still couldnt get the wire through i finally had to use a 11/16 paddle bit to drill the hole and feed the wire however on doing so since i was working with limited view into what is on the other side upstairs i ended up poking a hole in the baseboard molding everything is now wired and stuff but this unsightly hole is left behind on baseboard molding can you please help me on what i need to do to patch this hole up pictures below,0

advice request - paint-pros this paint wont spread at all bad brand or inherent hello diyers in a nutshell: i have [this acrylic latex](https://wwwlowescom/pd/valspar-satin-perfect-white-latex-paint-actual-net-contents-128-fl-oz/1000069149) paint i really like how hard it dries but it doesnt seem to cover well and it doesnt seem to flow/spread well at all with those two properties i need multiple coats for coverage but its a pita to apply those coats because it spreads so poorly this stuff is thick kind of like honey-thick does this specific brand suck or is it just the way acrylic latex is &#x200b; not in a nutshell: im currently doing some last minute painting to get our house ready to put on the market i previously had some paint stick and peel off of doors where they meet the jamb through some google-fu i found that latex paints dry somewhat tacky and continue to have a tacky feel to them for days/weeks which can cause peeling like i had on paint-to-paint surfaces the solution was to use latex formulas that had acrylic added to their formulas which results in a much harder finish i had to do some trim in a laundry closet as well as paint the interior of the space i figured even though its trim paint ill just throw it on the walls too so i dont have to go buy more paint i expected it to cover amazingly given how thick it was the coverage was terrible and it was so horrible to spread i ended up using an entire gallon to cover a 3x8 closet since there was a lot of new drywall and spackle i thought maybe those surfaces were just very porous and sucked up a lot of paint well now i am doing the closet doors and other trim so i bought another gallon this gallon too spreads terribly its taking me forever to paint one side of a panel door i just dont know if this is the way all acrylic latex paints are and i just need to deal with it or if it is inherent to this particular brand i dont want to waste money buying another brand if its going to be more of the same,0

should i use molybdenum disulfide grease i know molybdenum disulfide grease/paste isnt suitable for all applications so i want to make sure its the correct choice for my application before proceeding the application is hardened steel shafts sliding in an aluminum housing (machined cast aluminum with some porosity) no bearing/bushing material whatsoever (poor design i know but its what i have to work with) the movement is purely low-speed axial sliding zero rotation theres a segment on each shaft that has grooves for detent pins the pins and grooves are both hardened steel but i suspect the tips of the pins and the crests of the detent grooves are worn well-through the case hardening so my primary concern is minimizing additional wear on the detent grooves and pins secondary concern is smooth movement in the aluminum housing im certain the shafts experience occasional side loading but i have no idea how high the loads are and for what duration the parts make up the shifter assembly of a transmission which is exposed to splash lubrication so contamination of the gear oil needs to be considered (ball roller and needle bearings are present as well as an external fluid pump and heat exchanger but no syncros to worry about \[dog box\]) is this a suitable application for moly paste the stuff i have on hand is loctite lb8012 (65% mos2 supposedly),0

ac unit crapped out so last night my ac unit stopped cooling my home i thought it was odd considering the nights in georgia are much cooler than the days and it ran fine all day i replaced the air filter because i have been sending hardwoods and even though i covered the returns while sanding dust could have clogged up the filter so i set the thermostat to on instead of auto and head out to work at some point during the day my wife shut the thermostat off when i get home i put the thermostat to auto and now the outdoor condenser wont start on its own i cleaned off the coils and can get the condenser unit running if i push start the fan after about 10-15 minutes i notice a hissing noise not high pitched but it is constant it stops when i shut off the unit but starts again if i restart it ive tested the power all looks good 250 volts to unit continuity across all the connectors for the capacitors all i notice is a humming noise when the condenser is trying (unsuccessfully) to start on its own and hissing/kinda electrical smell when i get it running at this point im stumped and kinda out of ideas,0
vibrating washing machine makes things fall off hi diy so i have a tiny apartment most people have more storage space in their cars than i have in my apartment :) id like to maximize what i have (more background: college student so assume broke yes but not completely broke (because of all the money i save on my tiny apartment) also assume i dont know the names of tools or how to do much more than use a drill im willing to learn though and have friends that can help if i need a professional your idea is likely a bit outside the scope of what im looking to pursue i have a stacked washer/dryer with plenty of room on top of it as expected when i put boxes on top of this they sometimes fall due to the vibrations from the washer/dryer running i can fit a lot up there so i need to sit down and take the time to figure out the way to do this ive played with quite a few ideas ill spare you the really bad ones first here is a picture what i want to do is secure large storage bins to the top of the dryer or above the dryer\* example storage bins [https://wwwikeacom/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/](https://wwwikeacom/us/en/p/kuggis-box-with-lid-white-10280203/) others would be fine too if any advantages i want to be able to take the entire storage bin off the top to interact with the contents ideally id stack two but ill either have to test to make sure the top couldnt get thrown off/is locked in tightly enough or also secure the top bin separately my best (pls dont laugh) idea so far is to attach a hook to each wall (marked by the red xs in my pic the left x is meant for the shower wall not the back wall) then drill a small hole into each side of the bin then some of caribiner / detachable rope / dog leash cut to length unhook take it down rehook it will move around when washer/dryer on but cannot fall similar alternatives include a rope or bungie cord across the front but not actually attached the bin cant fall off but id have to lift it over instead of detaching (not a problem but the installation of this doesnt really seem any better/easier) or even something like a 2/4 installed across (this just seems like it would be uglier) shelves seem like a fail as theyd be quite far back i also dread the installation will admit there are some clear advantages though and could be convinced \*as i was editing this post i realized its on top or above the dryer perhaps the best option is installing a platform that rests on the shower-wall and attaches to the right wall the advantage being that nothing moves at all when using washer/dryer which means no need to drill into/find a way to attach bins and easier to get them down and back up plus i could definitely stack them this seems like a much better idea if i can teach myself how to install something like this open to totally different ideas as well as implementation ideas/products if you think i should go with my idea i said dog leashes only half-jokingly; i have no idea how to properly shop for a project like this / what these items are actually called i can even construct something that extends all the way over the shower if you sell me on an idea there is another 18 inches to the left in the provided pic i can provide exact measurements and additional pics if useful thank you for reading really looking forward to this appreciate any advice or random tips no matter how small i promise updates and cute pics claire,0

[q] using a router to make roof boards we need to change the roof on our playhouse we dont want to spend a lot of money on this so we decided on using completely ordinary square boards ([https://iimgurcom/dzgflj7png](https://iimgurcom/dzgflj7png)) that has a treatment that makes them better resist being outdoors this is the roof we have to replace buying the same stuff new is 3x the cost of ordinary square boards [https://iimgurcom/zomi3kypng](https://iimgurcom/zomi3kypng) **my question is how do we build it with square boards while still ensuring that the water will run off** ive been thinking maybe you can position them cleverly (overlapping of course) or maybe somehow use a router to make the boards overlap and silicone that overlap,0

uk - new house - advice requested evenin all just about to buy our first house and theres a few initial things i want to do especially in the extension ive added some photos below but the extension is wooden and according to surveyor a bit more like a glorified shed than an actual extension (still a few more days before i get the full report through) i want to pull off the t&g boards insulate it and then plasterboard etc to make it into an office/playroom is that possible or is it just a waste of time and i should just stick with it for a couple of years until i can afford to rip it down and build a new one or is it diy-able im reasonably decent at doing bits and pieces especially with the help of google & youtube to fill in the blanks cheers &#x200b; [inside](https://ireddit/wain8cffa7n31jpg) &#x200b; [outside](https://ireddit/dcwcx1hga7n31jpg),0

what can i put behind my freestanding deck we have a freestanding deck but its torn up and we are going to replace it the only issue is it obstructs about a foot of vinyl siding for 12 feet or so along the back of the house we want to replace the siding at some point in the future and if we build another deck well have to tear it down to get at it i know i can attach the deck to the house but i was hoping to avoid that for a bunch of reasons including that we dont currently have any kind of step leading out to the deck and wed have to have one with the flashing so other than attaching the deck to the house what can i do is there any kind of siding or board i could put behind the deck to stop the vinyl siding run before it goes being the deck basically making it look like the deck is attached without attaching it,0

new office chair: how to care and maintain so it lasts as long as possible hi all i just purchased a new desk chair what can i do to ensure this lasts as long as possible specifically * how can i keep the material in the best shape i can the material isnt leather on purchase i was told it is pvc plastic * how can i ensure the casters continue to roll smoothly * how can i ensure the chair remains as sturdy as it is now my previous chair literally fell apart because i did not care for it at all: * the arm rest became loose then broke off * the chair tilted onto one leg then that leg eventually snapped off * the casters eventually began to stop rolling the chair began to slide (instead of roll) and the plastic on the casters began to shred away this chair will get a fair amount of use ill sit in ~6 days a week for ~8-10 hours each day the chair was purchased new but without any instructions/documentation (i live in thailand) thanks in advance,0

chair in apartment bedroom uneven due to warped and sunken floor how should i deal with this [here](https://iimgurcom/it0a71qpng) is a very rough diagram of the situation basically the floor in this room of an old apartment is severely warped with several sunken areas and a differential of probably close to two inches from the lowest to highest points of my desk/chair area unfortunately this is the best spot in the room for my desk i doubt my landlord would do anything about it and even if he was willing to call in a professional it would be a huge pain for me i would probably have to move all of my furniture out for awhile as the room is on an overhang of the building and would likely require a lot of annoying work for the professional to come and fix its honestly slightly worrying in a long term structural integrity sense but hopefully there wont be any issues during the course of my lease for the desk itself i somehow managed to get it level with a combination of furniture pads for height and furniture leveling shims for the angles but the chair obviously remains tilted from one end of my plastic chair mat to the other there is probably at least half an inch of sinkage total this is rather uncomfortable as the front left of where the chair is resting is a sunken area and causes the chair to roll a bit and tilt in that direction i considered making or rather getting a carpenter or someone else to make a plywood platform with furniture levelers for the entire desk area but it would have to be pretty heavy duty to support everything and im not sure if it would be worth the cost and the effort of moving everything it would also take up a lot of space very awkwardly in this small room my next consideration is applying the same tactic i used on the desk (furniture pads and leveling shims) to the bottom of the chair mat to get things somewhat level and stuffing something underneath it to fill the gaps and make it relatively stable would this be a good idea if so what would be a good material to stuff underneath the mat if not what would be a good alternative solution any input would be appreciated edit: several people have suggested putting a sturdy piece of plywood or other type of board under the chair this is fine but i still have my concern of the board snapping or bending without any padding filling the gaps is there something i could use to fill in the empty space between the board leveled with shims and the floor,0
needing advice on repairing an old dryer or buying a new one i currently own a kenmore dryer (model 86980800) but the heating stopped working in it the dryer is easily 20+ maybe even 30+ years old now my wife and myself already ordered a new dryer from lowes(unsure of the brand of it) for like 420ish$ now that i am investigating the problem more i feel like i could at least attempt to fix it(i think the heating element went out on it but i will find out for sure in the morning) what i am trying to determine is am i getting something better by getting a new one is there been a lot of improvements to dryer quality in the last 20-30 years or would replacing it get me the same quality(read speed of heating) as a new dryer without the 400$ price tag fot reference my old dryer takes 70 minutes for a fullload of clothing but when my dad got a new one it went from similar time frame to like 30 minutes and if replacing the heating element gets me that i see no need for a new one,0

help needed on leveling a non-level poured basement floor (basement finishing) hello all i have spent the last 25 years renovating my home from 1910 and the last part of the project is the basement good news is i have no water penetration issues at all and the basement has poured concrete with 4 floor drains bad news the floor is uneven the problem is the poured concrete floor is sloped towards each of the 4 floor drains fantastic that someone did this but makes it impossible to have a flat floor to do a finished basement with a fake wood or tile floor i am searching for ideas on how anyone would level this floor its about 800 square feet and the highest point and lowest point (where the drains are) is a gentle slope difference of 25-3 inches i am not worried about water ingress down here as i have owned the house a long time it is on a hill and i have a french drain system around the outside potential solutions: i have thought about having additional concrete poured to smooth out the dips towards the drains i have also through about doing a floating 2x4 pressure treated floating subfloor essentially making pseudo beams that rest on the concrete and then placing a mdf floor on it and then my flooring of choice on top i would lose 3-4 inches of height if i did it this way thankfully the basement is fairly tall any other ideas here are some photos of the basement,0

"can i use my regular ground-sand as the sand in my concrete for a driveway extension i want to add about 20sq ft to my driveway to better-accommodate a parking-angle at any rate i usually use our sugar-sand soil (im by-the-beach in tampa-area fl) with portland #2 to make mortar and it works great however im unsure if this is something to mess with when doing a driveway extension would love to save the $ of not buying pre-mix (ie just buying portland & rocks and using my sugar-sand as the sharp-sand-aggregatte) but dont wanna risk a failed project will buy sakrete 5000 if its the smartest move but figured it was worth asking as a driveway extension is nothing like bonsai-pots (my main masonry endeavor though i have done structural projects that came out great just assuredly over-reinforced ie not cost-effective) also is rebar over-kill the driveway is a 4"" slab im planning to do a 6"" thick edge in the forms ill make for this so the slab gets thicker towards the end (so cars can go right-up-to the edge w/o worry) but am uncertain if its overkill to use rebar anywhere or metal-mesh rebar sheeting anywhere thanks a ton",0

how to attached large joists to a notched ledger board over windows hello i am in the process of replacing a very shottily built deck on my house (i am in the us) the old deck was held together by way too few and way too short of hardware--as well as virtually no treated lumber most of it rotted away when tearing it apart or the (non galvinized) hardware rusted and sheared in half i am shocked it supported the weight of the snow over the last winter after purchasing the house i planned on making the new deck larger (20 wide x 18 from the house) and thus went with much larger lumber the old deck was using a 6 ledger board and 6 joists (roughly 13 ft from the house and 15 ft long) the new deck i am moving to 2x12 ledger board and joists 16 center with a 4x12x24 beam bolted to four notched 6x6 posts for outer support w/ a small overhang my question is--the new ledger board overlaps two basement windows (split level house) as show in [this picture](https://iimgurcom/7spyrpbjpg) how would i go about attaching my joists to these areas best i can tell ill have at least 2-3 of these joists over each window and ill have 6-8 of meat to attach to here are my options as ive seen them so far please let me know if im missing something or if im even in the ballpark - i put two 12 joists on each side of the windows 6-8 off center with bridge blocking to strengthen up those areas and run notched joists over the windows - i notch my 12 joists to the size of the available ledger board and use smaller joist hangers (im concerned about a corner load on this option) - i cut a 45 degree angle into a 12 joist and notch only the part sitting in the joist hanger to minimize the corner load - i hang smaller 6-8 joists in these shorter areas (this would also be an issue since they other end would not be sitting on the beam at the same height as the 12 joists any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated i cant find much info online with installing a deck with windows in the way and theres nothing in the 2015 intl residential code (that my city uses) that answers this question my neighbor thinks i am overthinking it since im using 12 joists everywhere else on the deck but i am not as confident also i am aware the bottom ledger board hardware isnt installed yet--i didnt take into considering that id be going into my foundation wall thank you edit: the windows are 44 1/2 long,0

lf instruction on how to float vanity cabinet dear reader my dad had multiple floating bathroom cabinets (vanity tables) made custom by order sadly he never came around installing them so im taking on this task the only thing i am unsure of is how he envisioned to float the cabinets i would appreciate if someone could tell me how i can do that best see this album for pictures of the situation: to me the backpanel seems to thin to hang the whole cabinet on so my instinct tells me that i should bolt some wooden bars on the sides effectively creating an elevated level and placing the cabinet on top of these bars im afraid that will be visible though can anyone give me any instruction on how to float this cabinet properly thank you very much for taking time to read and instruct me,0

total diy novice here new radiator will be wider than the distance between the pipes from current towel heater is there a way to extend the existing pipes coming through the floor to the correct position rather than ripping up my laminate flooring im a complete novice here diy hasnt been something ive ever really done but my house is freezing in the winter and is currently full of single panel radiators so im upgrading to double panels (type 22s) which should help ive made sure to buy radiators that are the same width as the current ones so i shouldnt need to do anything to the current piping the coldest room in my house by far is the bathroom and theres only a towel heater in there right now looking at other towel heaters the btus are nowhere near close to what a similar sized radiator could offer so this absolutely needs replaced the problem is that the pipes on the towel heater go directly in to the bottom of it whereas a new radiator will need them to be further apart to go in to the sides where the inlets are so from my novice perspective i have two options and this is where i need clarification and help from you guys i can either take up the laminate flooring and try to do it the normal way but ive no clue what im doing there and theres a risk of breaking the laminate flooring this way (which i can nowhere near afford to replace; im only able to get the radiators because there was a clearance sale on near me and i got about 75% off them) my other option (and this is what i want to know if its possible and if so what i need) seems to be to just extend the current piping similar to in this professionally made artists impression i had commissioned: https://iimgurcom/tzbnpctpng is this doable (without welding) my only lead is some vague mention of an elbow on some forum somewhere (one of these: https://wwwscrewfixcom/p/tectite-sprint-copper-push-fit-equal-90-elbow-15mm/6486g ) im also worried that a setup like this would be more prone to leaks is this a legitemate concern or is it just as unlikely this way any help on what my options are and what i need for that would be appreciated,0

$5 one of a kind axe restoration from start to finish i picked up this rusty axe for $5 at the local flea market i wanted to create something a little abnormal in the axe-world so i did a metal etching design and then used a knife-like handle construction for the axe handle the image descriptions have full breakdown of the process i also have a time-lapse video on the entire creation video link below [video](https://youtube/bwbfzglj3ui) [the before and after](https://ireddit/0gdtiz97dvm31jpg) [step 1: i grinded the rusty axe head until all the rust was gone and i was left with a smooth surface ](https://ireddit/a2c3oku84vm31png) [step 2: i used an orbital sander from grits 60 up to 220 to smooth out the axe i then hand sanded up to 3000 grit sandpaper for a polished finish ](https://ireddit/ocn52iu84vm31png) [step 3: i used a solid white vinyl sticker over the entire axe head i then drew on a design and cut out parts to the design that i wanted to be etched into the axe ](https://ireddit/fcjctcu84vm31png) [step 4: the complete cut out of the design](https://ireddit/l1q8ogu84vm31png) [step 5 i used a battery pack along with salt water and a cotton ball to etch the metal design the electricity along with salt water created a reaction that eats away the steel ](https://ireddit/14pouiu84vm31png) [step 6: to create even more of an effect i used a rotary tool to further etch into the depressions of the design i really wanted the design to be a focal point in this axe ](https://ireddit/9lxwfnu84vm31png) [step 7: now on to the handle of the axe i constructed the handle like a knife with a full steel tang running throughout the entire handle ](https://ireddit/apwexmu84vm31png) [step 8: i used walnut and maple for the handle design ](https://ireddit/6otugnu84vm31png) [step 9: i cut out the handle shapes placed the steel tang inside and epoxied the sides together i then let to cure overnight ](https://ireddit/eoioahu84vm31png) [step 10: i shaped and sanded the handle smooth from 60-500 grit](https://ireddit/7kt2jdu84vm31png) [step 10: i used a tung oil and wax finishing paste to complete the handle i love how it turned out ](https://ireddit/myt5ecu84vm31png) [step 12: i test the axe: better seen in the video portion \(link in post description\) ](https://ireddit/rjv9q9u84vm31png) [the before and after \(be sure to check out the full video link in description above\)](https://ireddit/y7gqg0v64vm31jpg),0

refinished a basement bedroom,0
need to rig a rental-friendly barrier to prevent dog jumping out window whilst allowing cats to enter/exit cat run edit: i didnt mention it previously but the window is too narrow for a standard baby gate the dimensions (inside frame) are approximately 50cm/20in wide by 150cm/60in tall [window ill just preface by saying im renting so i cant drill new holes into the window frame or have a flap installed into the glass the problem: i have a cat run outside my bedroom window that is basically netting attached to the porch awning and balustrade (ie - not standalone)  the only way for my cats to access the run is via the open windowwhich was fine until my golden retriever discovered that not only could he jump out of the window but he could also chew through the netting - this has resulted in a few prison breaks and hes very proud of himself as you can see in the picture - the window in question is a hardwood-framed single casement window i need a physical barrier that prevents my budding houdini from practicing his agility skills whilst still allowing the cats to come and go as they please ive noticed there are some existing holes at the top of the frame (circled in red) from when there were previously hinges for an awning-style fly screen- i was thinking i might be able to use those to support/mount something itll either need to be rigged in a way that doesnt prevent the existing window closing or itll need to be easy to remove in case i need to close the window during bad weather etc ive got some pine and meranti planks of various sizes lying around so it would be ideal to use some of those but im not opposed to buying all-new supplies,0

suggestions re pimping motorcycle with loud sound for annual local pilgrimage a local annual pilgrimage takes place in which loads of bicycles come together to do bike ride together its common for bicycle owners to go creative and come up with funky air-horns and any sort of audible device below is just a setup ive done for couple of times basically it has to last throughout the event which is approx 3-4 hours apart from weight which to be fair was never an issue theres the heat and power supply concerns 12v compressor sucks up energy like a b\*$# and even worse is that everything heats up pretty quick sometimes it has to be left for durations of half-an hour to actually start working again after cooling down eventually it stopped during the last use only to find out that the brushes warmed up so much that they softened the plastic housing through which they slide to contact the armature and got stuck instead of springing as intended apart from bicycles on the same event theres a second group following along which consists of motorcycles which is were my question lies basically thought of doing some sort of setup to the motorcycle this time bikes a honda crf250l 2014 model am looking for suggestions for the below: \- what would be louder/smarter: air horns setup with 12v compressor/s or speaker setup with car head-unit not sure about small multichannel amplifier - either way i have to keep in mind heat concerns as everything will heat up no matter what so thermal cut-offs will ruin the plan \- as a power source would you suggest an external/extra car battery mounted on the bike and power is sourced through it directly also would you plug power from the bikes stator to the battery as to charge it or would you do without the extra battery and source everything through the bikes power source generation - would any use of the stator be too much for the bikes electric recharging system since it might be too much or the battery too big to recharge all along so no matter what i dont want to harm the bike in any way this is just an annual event yet adding some spark to it makes it a whole different thing :) &#x200b; this is a link for the mounted kit on the bicycle : [https://wwwebaycouk/itm/12v-duke-of-hazzard-dixie-land-dixieland-musical-tune-car-van-air-horn-kit-set/163798194520hash=item2623221958:g:jjcaaoswg8xb1vqu](https://wwwebaycouk/itm/12v-duke-of-hazzard-dixie-land-dixieland-musical-tune-car-van-air-horn-kit-set/163798194520hash=item2623221958:g:jjcaaoswg8xb1vqu) im after loudness re suggested setups temporary fabrication can be done to the bike to cater for equipment etc below is a picture of the bike:  suggestions guys n gals,0

question about grading around foundation hello all i posted this in r/landscaping as well but i figure i might be able to get some input here as well since i have been stressing about this thanks in advance for any info provided: i purchased a home when there was still a lot of snow outside and didnt notice the following grading issue on one awkward part of the house the following is a diagram of the area of my house: &#x200b; https://ireddit/6n6ihpokyom31png the house has rock all around it the green line represents the grass line and the red question mark is the problem area grading around the other areas of the house is pretty straight forward (from what ive been reading about an inch per foot or some say 6 inches every 10 feet) however this area presents a problem because it is much further away from the yard and the roof there is sloped on one side so sometimes water flows off the side into this area adding to the rain falling straight down ive been reading online that you should maintain a 6-8 clearance between soil and the bottom of the siding to prevent moisture problems as well as prevent termites and mice however if i obey that rule grading from the corner to the yard would result in essentially a ditch a 3-4 discrepancy between the work area and the yard line i am pretty sure that corner as it is is below the grade of my yard currently as well without removing the rock to fully analyze looking at the grade on the rest of the yard it looks like its not possible to obey both grading rules above i initially thought of adding a drain there to drain water into another part of the yard but i run into the issue again where because that area is equal grade or lower to the yard i cannot slope a pipe down to drain and then run off into the yard swale it would be far underground at that point i am kind of at a loss at this point according to my calculations i would need to stack soil about an inch or maybe an inch and a half from the bottom of the siding in order to achieve a decent grade regardless of whether or not i install a drain there is that fine as long as the water runs off correctly and doesnt gather there for additional info: i have vinyl siding and right behind the siding is a white styrofoam like material that sits on top of the foundation,0

tool choices i just purchased my first home with my fiancee and i decided i would get back into doing my own work i had been an apartment dweller for 12 years and have not had to fix anything since it was always covered now i am responsible i recently got a heck of a deal on kobalt 24v brushless power tools at my local lowes getting 4 batteries 2 chargers a circular saw a reciprocating saw an orbital sander impact drill drill/driver leaf blower weed eater led light and multi-tool for under 600 bucks my question is in the future if i decide to get other tools kobalt doesnt have the strong lineup such as dewalt ryobi craftsman etc and their 100+ tool lineups would it be worth investing into 2 systems to ensure i have all the tools i need or would it be better waiting for new pieces to be added to the kobalt brand i have no problem mixing and matching as the new house has plenty of garage space for me to store my tools but since i have been out of the diy game for 12 years perhaps there is something you guys could tell me about which route to go i just couldnt pass up such a great deal on a power tool set &#x200b; if you do recommend investing into a second system which one and if you could why thank you for your time in reading all this &#x200b; tl;dr- i have 9 pieces for kobalt power tools but i am looking to purchase more tools and the lineup is not as strong as the competition is it worth investing in a second tool system or waiting,0

how do i cut vinyl t-mold flooring transitions strips i have laminate floor in my living room with a tile area in front of the patio door the original transition strips around the tile just disintegrated over time so i bought vinyl transition strips to replace them i want to have tidy mitred corners but i can not figure out how to cut the strips in a straight and tidy way i tried using a utility knife jig saw and a cutting bit for a rotary multi-tool and none really worked well the strips are floppy but surprisingly tough and the top surface is convex so its hard to use a straight edge as a guidei thought this would be easy and im afraid of a) wasting material and b) making it look like garbage any hints would be greatly appreciated,0

electric winch install for home climbing wall hi yall not really a diy-guy so apologies if dumb questions: i have a 12ft x 8ft wall im looking to chain up in my garage it already has two sturdy eye bolts on the sides where it can be chained up to the wall and adjusted for overhang id like to make the raising and lowering of the overhang easier than manually adjusting the chains so i had in mind installing an electric winch up on the wall of the garage and hooking up the top of the wall to it the wall with holds probably weighs about \~450-500lbs my garage doesnt have any exposed beams making bolting a winch to the wall challenging without cutting through drywall do you think screwing a plank of wood crossing and attached to multiple studs on the wall and subsequently screwing the winch plate into this would provide enough support for the weight of the climbing wall i dont intend to climb on the wall with the winch - id hook the chains up to support the load of the wall and the climber similarly do you think pad eye plates screwed into the studs would support the two chains/weight of the wall any help would be appreciated thanks a bunch,0

"how do i finish (ie drywall and trim) a garage that has a concrete curb at the base of the wall **setup** were getting a pad poured right away and have the option of including a 6"" curb - something [like this](https://i2wpcom/wwwdirtwrightca/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/concrete-garage-slab-with-curb-1jpgssl=1) the final use of the building will be gym/sports bar but it will be built as a detached garage *without* a curb the framing will go down to the floor this makes drywall and baseboards and whatever else super easy with just screws and brad nails like normal *with* a curb we get added weather protection (alberta and snow) but then the aforementioned ease of installing drywall and baseboards is lost for those bottom 6 inches *i understand that this might seem like a trivial problem for a garage but keep in mind it isnt a garage or a shop; there is no vehicle/street access it is 100% a luxury and so the final finish is as important as anything else were doing drywall baseboards flooring - the whole nine yards* **question(s)** if we do have a curb what do we do about drywall and baseboards can the drywall be directly against the concrete curb with some poly in between the concrete will have 2"" or 4"" insulation underneath and around the external sides but im not sure if that is sufficient insulation to have the drywall directly in contact plus how would we attach the bottom of the drywall to the curb/poly and the baseboards to the drywall adhesives are our only option **caveats** we want the walls to be flat from floor to ceiling so no [ledges](https://ipinimgcom/originals/ff/4e/40/ff4e408b05f45173d9964a17f04de8f3jpg) or steps and we really do not want to sacrifice the area of our expensive pad with a [furring wall](https://img-awsehowcdncom/350x235p/photosdemandstudioscom/getty/article/103/133/87613340_xsjpg) **thanks** thanks for any insight as of right now the *no curb* option is the most attractive because it saves some $$ on the flatwork and makes finishing a lot friendlier (seemingly)",0

"can weeping tile sit on top of the footer or does it have to go beside the footing see [the diagram working on the exterior of a basement wall that has bowed in badly dont know for sure why it bowed in perhaps ice and water pressure (which is common to the area) tree roots traffic or some combination of factors anyway the wall has been hand excavated down to the footing which was a bear of a task dont actually know how far out the footing extends to since the trench isnt wide enough to fully expose the footer the plan is to straighten and brace the wall but in the meantime i want to do some prevention and add a weeping tile/drain pipe to at least improve the water situation if that is indeed a cause i really dont want to do any more excavating can i install a weeping tile drain on *top* of the footing most diagrams ive seen indicate it *beside* the footing but im not even sure how wide or how jagged this footing might be due to various issues i really dont want to widen the trench unless its critical to do so ive seen some diagrams referencing a ""foundation drain"" that seems to sit on top of the footing the frost line ranges 4 to 7 feet and the footing would be close to that my instinct is to put the drain on top of the footing surrounded by gravel and that it will be at least some improvement over the current situation the idea is it would hold some excess water and at least reduce hydrodynamic stress on the wall",0

[help] stained base board refinishing - guidance needed hello all i am very new to wood working and would like some guidance on best resources to learn how to best touch up/refinish my base boards as part of the project to have my wood floors refinished i removed my base boards so that the contractors could access all of the wood floor boards and thought to take the opportunity to also refinish these boards the boards themselves seemed to have lost a bit of vibrancy and the original stain and topcoat were applied on the boards when they were first nailed onto the wall not separately as a result residue from this process accumulated on the bottom edge of these boards and there are areas where no stain was applied (these areas generally dont see the light of day but it annoys me none-the-less) the original plan to refinish these boards was to sand down the layer of topcoat and a bit into the stained wood then re-stain and topcoat the sanded boards below are pictures of this process (different boards at different stages) i apologize for the lighting glare on the boards original board: close-up of old stain/topcoat residue: board after sanding (120 grit sand paper): board after stain and topcoat: in general the board above came out decent looking but some other boards came out more uneven and blotchy i was recommended using a board conditioner before applying stain and have yet to try that i wanted to get some second opinions on the direction in case there is a better way to go about this am i approaching refinishing these boards correctly what resources would you recommend me using in order to better understand how to best refinished stained wood base boards thank you in advance for your assistance,0

drainage pipe questions: perforated french drain or solid pipe with spill basin i live in tn and this year thus far we have had a ton of rain it has made the drainage in my backyard along my fence (about 100 feet) a nightmare about 4 feet out along my fence is completely soggy i originally thought of doing just a perforated 6 inch french drain inside some rock and fabric however with all the rain behind my tree at the corner of the fence there is some standing water multiple people i have talked to have said install a catch/spill basin in that corner and connect it to pipe and carry it out one guy said use solid pipe (no holes) that way as it catches the water in the corner it will carry it out and no additional water can be deposited in the soil so eventually it can dry out another one has said to do the catch basin but still connect it to perforated pipe (like the classic french drain) he says as the water is flowing it will flow too quickly through the pipe and wont be able to deposit any additional water to the soil and the holes will additionally capture any extra water from the soil first guy (solid pipe guy) said he has done this on a property he owns and it solved the problem but that his soil was never as soggy as mine is so what is the best way to go about this do i need to use solid pipe connected to the catch basin or go the classic french drain route (with perforations/holes surrounded by rock surrounded by fabric) connected to the catch basin note that the pipe will be underground about 100 feet or so and will connect/empty into my neighbors ditch that they dug for drainage my yard does has a slight grade over half of it both guys have said they will dig a grade into the ditch note that there may be an underground stream/spring somewhere (this seems to be a new development) do i need solid pipe or perforated pipe for this i want to carry rain through the catch basin while it is actively raining but i also want to help my yard dry out,0

first diy project - $600 bathroom refresh [link to after 2 years of homeownership i decided to tackle my first project which was to refresh the bathroom i dont want to call it a renovation because that sounds too major but it was a little more involved than just redecorating i didnt want to get in over my head (i have no diy experience) and i also didnt want to break the bank so i had a budget of $750 but was hoping to keep it under $500 i ended up spending about $600 here are a breakdown of some of the costs: new vanity top - $250 new light fixture -$75 new faucet -$68 mirror - $55 paint -$35 random tools/supplies from home depot - ~ $100 towel bar and shower rod -$40 i was able to sell the old mirror i had to recoup a little of the cost this took me just over a week of working on it on and off after work i wish i had more before pictures but i think i took it up a few notches while sticking to a budget and getting some diy confidence before anyone comments that i should paint the cabinet white im considering it but this matches the cabinets in my kitchen im still on the fence about whether i want to jump on the white cabinet trend hopefully i can inspire another total diy noob to try something out ive already learned a lot and im starting to think about what to do next,0

diy powerbridge solution folks - i am finishing my basement as part of this i would like to run led lights strips in a crown molding this will need to plug into an outlet instead of putting a physical real outlet at the ceiling location i am exploring a powerbridge solution there is a commercially available solution as follows: https://wwwpowerbridgesolutioncom/product/projector-single-outlet-power-cable-extension-kit i looked into it and when you break it apart it is an outlet romex cable and an inlet that plugs into a standard wall outlet so i am going the diy route i installed the blue electrical boxes circled in blue in the picture below and ran a romex between them i will then use the top one as an outlet and bottom one as an inlet which will plug into the regular outlet circled in red is this against code the romex will run within the wall the commercial powerbridge solution link i posted above says it is up to code so why should my diy be different,0

reparing drywall with missing paper above shower - need help on the order of steps the latex paint on the walls above this shower pictured below started peeling i scraped the paint off but much of the paper from the drywall also came off i would like to have the finished project be painted and have a bead of caulk between the shower and the drywall to prevent moisture from causing the peeling later down the line 1 i have cleaned the area and applied a coat of romanrx-35 pro-999 interior drywall repair and sealer primer 2 i plan on applying a 2nd coat of pro-999 3 next i will apply and sand sheetrock brand all-purpose pre-mixed joint compound 4 then i will prime with kilz premium interior/exterior multi-purpose water-based wall and ceiling primer 5 then i will paint with a satin latex paint 6 then i will apply kwik seal kitchen and bath adhesive caulk around the top of the shower where it meets the wall where i am doubting myself is on the order of steps 3 through 6 above is this the best order or would another method be preferable thank you in advance https://ireddit/xc7luyk4r1m31jpg,0
"help: will a drywall anchor 7/16"" from a toggle bolt in the drywall make both weaker im hanging support brackets for wall shelves the studs dont line up so im hanging from the drywall each bracket has two holes 3/4"" apart for screws my plan is to use a toggle bolt in one and an expanding drywall anchor in the other [like the toggle bolt should be the strongest against force pulling out from the wall and the drywall anchor should help with both outward and downward pressure theres a third hole at the bottom of the bracket that will also have a drywall anchor my concern is that drilling a 3/8"" hole to get the toggle bolt behind the drywall so close to a 1/4"" hole for the anchor will only leave a 7/16"" bit of drywall between them that drywall will split if it cant withstand the outward pressure of the anchor pushing into the mostly empty hole of the toggle bolt if that happens it seems like the toggle bolt will be more likely to break out am i better off just using a toggle bolt without the anchor next to it",0
electrical dilemma hello all relatively new here i hope this is the right spot for this question couple days ago with central vac running the vacuum just cut out upon resetting the breaker which was what we assumed nothing on the circuit works on the same circuit are two light fixtures three wall outlets these are connected to a 15a breaker that is part of a quad-type breaker all four 15a breakers on the quad are independent - none of them are linked none of them trip either (will stay on) diagnosis so far: 1) with the breakers on im getting \~118v in the outlets that dont want to power anything 2) amperage reads low on the wire at breaker (using clamp-multimeter) 3) i switched the wire to an empty 15a \[not on the same quad-type but a different set\] - no change 4) when a night-light is plugged in to the outlets it turns on but significantly less bright does the quad type breaker need to be replaced altogether could this be a different problem altogether any and all help much appreciated :),0

"[question / advice] self leveling underlayment corner so this is a bit of a long story but ill try to keep it short after crunching numbers and time investment i decided that pouring self leveling underlayment during my kitchen renovation would be better (for me) than tearing up the existing peel and stick from the 70s the sub floor and leveling it the ""proper"" way the house is really old and potentially sealing off any asbestos was part of the motivation to go this route we screwed up our first pour by going with a crappy product with bad instructions and following them without second guessing (which is our fault) leading to wayyyyy too thick of a pour leading to mounding / hilly-ness we tore it up and poured a different brand that suggest wayyy more water and we even used a touch more water than suggested the floor leveled amazingly compared to the first time through all that i still screwed up and forgot to tear out the door frame / trim as we intended on making it an open walkway instead of a door one corner ended up fine the other got busted up during removal [photos any of you fine folks have an idea as to how i might best patch this i have no intention of tearing up the leveler again lol thank you all for your time edit: just to provide as much info as i can we are laying 12x24"" vinyl tile with built in substrate on top of this",0

addressable rgb led strip for my room hi guys im new to r/diy and actually new to diy projects ive tried searching and i found a lot of info about addressable rgb led lights but im still very lost my main goal is to put an adressable rgb led strip on the walls in my room (36m x 46m) i know i want it to be addressable because id like to connect it to an arduino (or a raspberry) and have more control over it im not a programmer but the software part im not afraid of the hardware is what scares me i found that i need to buy ws2812/b lights im reading though that ill need a separate power for the lights and i dont know how to set that up i believe my request is very straight-forward but i dont know what to look for and what parts to buy what i think would be an ideal setup is to have a long led strip (164m) programmed by me with the additional extra of maybe switching between the programs with a remote but i think thats diving deep now since i started mentioning extras another extra id like is some automation based on the ambient lighting/time or motion detection activation but id be happy with just the led strip + arduino part for starters any advice for starting out is welcome and apologies for my noobiness i dont want you to spoon-feed me information but i wont mind :d thanks,0

what is the best option for safely storing household chemicals ive got some curious young kids and some dumbass dogs im worried about the paint thinner butane fertilizer weed killer etc that i have laying around the garage been considering a metal file cabinet (often cheap on craigslist) for storing that stuff behind a lock and key i can just put it on a high shelf but my kids are talented climbers and know how to set up the ladder because i encourage them to help on home improvement projects the recommendations i see online are mostly for commercial settings and i feel like a $5000 fire-proof cabinet is overkill i am a bit worried about offgassing leaking and corrosion if i put these chemicals in an enclosed space not designed for the purpose im no chemist though where do you store your chemicals,0

light magnetic ball - recommendation i was hoping for someone to provide some recommendations im working on a project using some servos and magnets i essentially want to suspend a 1 inch metal ball against a surface parallel with the wall then have servos move some magnets on the other side to move the ball so it looks like its floating i have high torque servos but i would like to try to make it a cheaper project using small metal gear servos i 3d modelled an arm that has bearings on the end to reduce friction from the magnets dragging the 3d printed parts i printed everything and programmed it and it works as it should the issue is that the metal bearing (ball) i originally bought are too heavy for the servos to handle i was hoping someone had a recommendation for a light or hollow metal ball that is magnetic the only hollow metal balls i can find are 304 stainless steel i appreciate any suggestions,0

"thinset mortar demineralizing or dissolving in a shower has anyone ever heard of thinset under a tile floor in a shower simply dissolving and re-depositing on the surface of the tiles i have a tiled shower that i did the install on about 4 years ago and recently noticed one or two tiles are slightly loose or ""rocking"" and when i step on them water seeps out of the grout lines ive also noticed that theres hard scale buildup downstream of the grout lines eg the direction the water is flowing towards the drain its very thick in some areas like 1/8"" the tiles were installed over redgard painted membrane the membrane itself seems fine theres no signs that its compromised or that water is leaking through it or anything",0
"door refinishing on the easy and cheap i have 3 doors in my house that over the years from dogs and the previous owners wheelchair have suffered quite a bit of damage we are planning on selling the house and i dont have the proper jig to re-mortise the hinges for a new door slab so this is the next easiest step for me thankfully all of them were only on one side of the door although this could have been done on both sides but your door will then be 212"" thicker since each project panel is 106"" thick [these](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/utility-panel-common-1-8-in-x-4-ft-x-8-ft-actual-0-106-in-x-48-in-x-96-in-833096/100543684) are the panels i used they are standard 4x8"" (48""x96"") and hd will cut them for you which if youre in my same situation you need them cut down to fit in your vehicle only select home depots carried them but other stores may have something similar products the online description says 106"" thick but the store label said 5mm this was a better and cheaper option than veneer which i couldnt even find anyone local that sold rolls wide enough here is the project at hand this is only one of three doors i did i am very happy with the way they turned out",0

is it impossible to install my clothes storage system hi all i am completely new to home renovation i bought this [clothes storage system](https://wwwwayfaircouk/storage-organisation/pdp/space-pro-relax-189cm-wide-clothes-storage-system-sppo1037html) and hired a handyman to install it we ran into 2 issues: 1my wall is apparently super weak and not able to support the system securely let alone one with clothes the instruction manual says that the system can be mounted onto brick breeze block concrete stone or wood as long as the appropriate wall plugs are used which are not provided the handyman used some wall plugs that he brought along but later said that because the wall is so thin and weak that no wall plug is able to secure the load (when he drilled into the wall powders and wool came out) he recommended that i get a wood plank to strengthen the wall before attaching the system i have contacted the manufacturer of the system and they say they have never encountered such problem before so they cannot give any advice on that 2my floor is carpet with underfloor heating and cannot be drilled i didnt know that the system needed to be drilled into the floor before i purchased it i suppose it is to prevent it from moving which totally makes sense now i have found alternative stanchions from the same manufacturer that is floor to ceiling instead of floor to wall and that works with other existing components of the system it takes away the issue with the wall but still leaves the second issue unsolved i would imagine if the stanchions were installed tight enough friction with the carpet would prevent movements but there is obviously a risk so these are my questions: 1 is there any way to secure the system to a reasonably safe capacity without drilling the floor and how 2 if the floor issue can be solved is it better to go with the wood plank solution or to buy the floor to ceiling stanchions instead many many thanks,0

best way crush mixed brick and concrete rubble knocked down a crumbling post-ww2 shed/coal storage/outhouse building recently and now im stuck with a reasonable pile of rubble the walls were brick and the roof was mesh reinforced concrete ive knocked most the concrete off the mesh now and can chuck that away or save it for a use later however im now stuck with quite a bit of rubble ive saved as many bricks and paving slabs as are still usable but i still need to crush the rest of the rubble for budget hardcore aggregate and crappy garden gravel since removal isnt an option due to location and local tip disposal rule changes i have an old sledgehammer that ive been using which warped and nearly deheaded and due to blisters and cuts on my hands isnt exactly fun to use time is also an issue as i have to find spare time around work and college is there a better way to crush rubble into smaller pieces is there a tool or machine i could rent reasonably cheaply to replace the dying sledgehammer and save my hands cheers,0

question about insulating exterior wall with no sole or top plate the wife and i recently bought a house which was built in the 1880s that had an addition at some point in the mid 1900s knob and tube horse hair plaster all the good stuff weve gut one of the rooms that well turn in to the master and are now putting it all back together again as part of this were insulating the exterior walls since theyre open the building inspector was pretty clear about having a continuous vapor barrier on exterior walls (even though none of the rest of the house is insulated but i get it) however due to the construction of the exterior walls the studs run down to the first floor with no sill plate and up to the attic with no top plate ive purchased and stuffed the holes with rock wool per the inspectors suggestion but im left trying to figure out the best way to attach the vapor barrier at the top and bottom it feels a little pointless since the rest of the walls arent insulated at all but here we are im using faced fiberglass batts to create the vapor barrier but dont have anything to staple to the top or bottom of the batt to since the bay is just open at either end any suggestions,0

need help setting up a baseball machine for my little brother so im off to college and my little brother is bummed out im not there to use our baseball machine with him im thinking of setting up an automatically feeder for him as a weekend project when i go home to visit in a few weeks heres the pitching machine we have from spinball essentially you put a ball into the ball feeder tube chute (red arrow) and the pitching machine spits the ball out with its spinning wheels &#x200b; [spinball pitching machine](https://ireddit/4tg0fxow7ql31png) now the automatic feeder essentially stores baseballs and releases one every 10 seconds or so into the pitching machine for you eliminating the need to have someone feed the machine baseballs &#x200b; here is the automatic feeder my pitching machine company makes but at $800 its well outside my price range [spinball feeder](https://ireddit/6npf7fga8ql31png) &#x200b; here is a makeshift feeder someone made (not sure what they used as the motor and not sure how it attaches to the machine) &#x200b; [makeshift](https://ireddit/i683fprv8ql31jpg) &#x200b; i was able to find two automatic feeders online from heater sports for only $60 which is certainly affordable and probably a better route than making my own feeder &#x200b; [heater sports automatic feeders](https://ireddit/enetgceq9ql31png) &#x200b; the two poles on the automatic feeder attaches to their two holes on their pitching machine as shown below &#x200b; [heater pitching machine](https://ireddit/4gaen5y2aql31png) &#x200b; but my pitching machine doesnt have two holes for their automatic feeder so now the million dollar question is **how do i attach their automatic feeder onto my pitching machine** &#x200b; (1) my ball chute (where baseballs go in - red arrow on the first picture and the two images below) is actually removable it has a bracket it attaches to my preference is to some how use heater sports feeder and using nuts/bolts and attaching it to my bracket of my pitching machine then i can easily use flexible tubing to connect the feeder to my ball chute but the hard part is how do i get nuts and bolts to attach to the automatic feeder and my pitching machine (2) probably the easiest method would be to attach the automatic feeder directly to my ball chute its made of hard plastic and should hold up the weight of the feeder and baseballs but i have no idea how id attach the automatic feeder to my ball chute (3) third method would be to some how get the automatic feeder on its separate tripod stand (similar to what spinballs automatic feeder is) then i could easily use flexible tubing to connect it to my pitching machine again the part that needs figuring out is how to attach the automatic feeder onto a tripod &#x200b; have basic typical tools most households have (drill screwdriver wrench etc) dont have access to or know how to weld &#x200b; &#x200b; [my insert ball chute ](https://ireddit/wnanqsbzbql31png) &#x200b; [my insert ball chute](https://ireddit/po7lycg1cql31png),0

paver base install months in advance hello all the title is pretty straightforward but to add some clarity: i am installing a patio in my backyard of my new home my plan would be to outline excavate and install paver base this fall i would follow-up with the paver sand and pavers in the spring i would likely wait until the spring to compact the base as well im in michigan for what its worth i know this probably isnt the most logical cadence but my motivation for this is two-fold - i am on a budget and couldnt afford to do the whole patio this year anyway but paver base seems to be the lowest investment of the project so easier to stretch it out secondly the psychological part of it is we have several other projects going on and i seem to get frozen and get nothing accomplished this way ill feel like ive tackled a huge part of the patio without having to invest too much ive done some quick research on paver base install in advance and such but only seem to come up with tutorials for on how to install to patios and nothing on the longevity of exposed paver base,0

arduino triggering relays randomly hi all im working on a school project trying to make a standing desk and ive run into some significant issues trying to get my arduino working well with my relay board module (made for arduino) since the start of the project the relays have been temperamental sometimes triggering themselves randomly with no trigger to do so from the code a mock up of the layout and wiring can be seen [here](https://wwwtinkercadcom/things/co5mkuogwpy-copy-of-copy-of-standing-desk-button-control-system/editelsharecode=m0hhwstkuzu2ijt8r2uctqfopnhh7zscyrbyfxblaxq=) (the rest of the code is for ultrasonic sensors to keep the desk level but this issue has been occurring for ages before any of that code was there) &#x200b; the system can go through periods of relative stability but usually have one or two relays toggling randomly (no button press nothing else even plugged into the arduino other than power) they can also be provoked by touching the wires/plugging something else in (and then continue to toggle on and off after that) on/off duration can last anywhere from a fraction of a second to about 10 seconds &#x200b; why would the relays be triggering randomly and how do i fix it potentially a dodgy arduino any help would be greatly appreciated as its due next week and im becoming increasingly stressed thanks in advanced &#x200b; arduino: uno r3 relay board: [duinotech xc-4440](https://wwwjaycarcomau/arduino-compatible-4-channel-12v-relay-module/p/xc4440) &#x200b; edit: problem solved replaced the cables with copper strip board and the problem seems to have been solved maybe the issue was noise as the cables were pretty thin/cheap thank you everyone for your help,0

looking for cellar advice with mould issues (uk) hey weve a late 1800s end terrace with a cellar when we moved in (april this year) we got it tanked with membrane over walls and floor and plasterboard put up over the walls and boarding on the floor theres also an old victorian cold stone table which didnt get covered and is still in contact with the outside wall the steps down havent been covered either we then filled it with our extra stuff to be unpacked later after a few weeks we found significant dark patches of mould behind boxes and so scrubbed them with lots of anti-mould spray from b&q it was cold and 80% humidity so to reduce this weve purchased a small dehumidifier rated for a room of that size and had it running pretty much continuously for 3 months the humidity can get as low as 43% but if its off for a few days it rises up to 60-70% again since the first mass clean of mould in april/may we saw a few patches develop but we havent seen any mould in the past month or two but im a little worried about when it gets colder outside weve recently had radiators fitted to deal with the cold and they seem to be able to keep it at or above 21c though theyve only been needed the last 2 weeks do you think i should be concerned if so would covering the stone table/steps help or using anti-mould paint on the walls,0

advice regarding shed renovation please ok when i moved in here 9 years ago i acquired a garden so bought myself a little shed for storage and give myself a crafting space whilst most of it has held up well the front and the roof has taken the brunt of the british weather so before winter sets in i want to do a little renovation work but ive not tackled a project like this before and funds are limited so before i go into this id like to pick your brains on this please the pitched roof that was supplied is made of chipboard and its not survived the rain especially as the asphalt that covered it has shrunk somehow exposing it i plan on replacing it with osb and replacing the rather lacklustre beam inside with something more substantial four rafters running down the length of the pitch two at each end and a couple in the middle i want to use birdmouth joints for this something ive not tried before i also want to increase the pitch of the roof slightly to aid run off in heavy weather can i do this by adjusting the birdmouth joints or do i need to adjust the height of the back and front wall of the shed the front would be easy as that is being replaced anyway if i only make the front taller though itll require adjusting the side walls and thats whole extra bucketful of work i hadnt planned on also happy to take on any other advice you may have thanks for reading and a preemptive thank you for your advice,0

tried to clean mold off an interior granite wall now it smells awful anything i can do to fix this [help request] hi [uk btw] if this isnt the place for this then let me know and ill delete it im just somewhat desperate as my room/study in my house is somewhat uninhabitable now i have a granite wall in my house which has a mold problem on the inside its a feature granite section that i believe goes all the way to the outside which has been pebble dashed a mix of white and dark mold had grown across this wall and i attempted to clean it by painting on thick bleach waiting 2 hours then sponging off with water the bleach did foam a lot (like really a lot) and i dont know how successful i was in taking it off since doing this ive ventilated heavily for 2 days and run fans and dehumidifiers overnight the dehumidifier isnt picking up much water so i can only assume that the air isnt damp the issue is there is a very strong mold/damp smell in the room now which wasnt present before attempting to bleach the mold is there anything i can do here or a product i can apply to kill the mold/block this smell ive only been living there for a year and a half so im not sure what the previous tenants did to the wall before i moved in but another thought that occurred is that the granite might have been sealed or varnished in some way and my bleaching has removed this barrier allowing the damp wall smell to come into the room any help or advice on solutions/products would be much appreciated research online offers a million solutions to general mold issues from spraying vinegar to renting an industrial chemical fogger (i dont even know if i could get one where i am) but the mold is surely dead from the bleach so im not sure where the awful smell is coming from thanks rewan **edit** for info the current plan seems to be to attack the granite wall with a dedicated anti-mold spray then use a granite sealer to hopefully put a barrier between the room and any damp/mold im researching appropriate products at the moment,0

no hot water since detaching radiator; still no hot water after reattaching radiator hi all first-time house buyer here i moved into my new flat three weeks ago and set about decorating straight away i had perfect hot water supply from my boiler until i removed the radiator two weeks ago to strip wallpaper/paint behind it i had no issues removing the radiator (i bled it first) but for reasons i dont understand it meant no hot water in the kitchen or bathroom when i switched on the hot taps water came out of the pipes that led to the radiator (which i thought id switched off the valves) no problem with cold water ive been having bucket showers with water heated up in the kettle since today i reattached the radiator - straightforward however no hot water still anywhere - kitchen or bathroom when i turn on hot taps my boiler immediately fires up and i have no leaks ive had the taps running for well over an hour at this point the boiler is working but no hot water the pipes dont feel hot either i have no idea what the issue is the radiator is a thermostatic one and ive played around with the settings on it the only observation i have is that there is a pressure meter on the boiler thats reading 0 bar (i have no idea if it was reading higher when the hot water was active when i moved in because i didnt check - im guessing it should be higher) any ideas what i could have done wrong pretty desperate for a proper shower at this point - i took a weeks holiday to decorate the flat and resigned myself to being filthy back at work tomorrow though and a bucket shower may not cut it any tips are greatly appreciated s\_b edit for anyone who happens to stumble across this via google: boilers need to be pressurised when i bled the radiator i took all the pressure out of the boiler system so while my boiler was firing up when i turned on hot water taps none of that water was getting into the pipes fixing it was as simple as finding out how to repressurise my particular model of boiler (a worcester combi) it simply involved removing the bottom cover locating the valve key (conveniently attached to the cover) and opening the mains valve to the boiler and keeping an eye on the pressure gauge to get it up to 15 bar once that was done plenty of lovely hot water whole thing took five minutes including watching the youtube video it took me longer to reattach the boiler cover,0

hardwood floor refinishing question - can i use a handheld belt sander for a small area i just bought a house - havent taken possession yet - which has a small area of oak hardwood floor in the kitchen/dining room area the hardwood seems to be in good condition but the finish is worn where the current/past owners had an area rug under the dining table and the high traffic area near the patio door the kitchen part has an island so the exposed floor is a narrow u-shaped aisle i am fairly experienced at hardwood floor sanding/finishing having done the floors in an 1000 sq ft home a few years ago i did a large living/dining room hallway and three bedrooms using a big commercial drum sander and disk edger and then applied varathane finish for this new house the area is quite small and using a big drum sander and edger seems impractical is it silly to think of using just a handheld electric belt sander with an oscillating tool for edges and corners to do this job,0

"diy 21 stereo tactile transducer ""buttkickers"" tactile transducers if you are unfamiliar are basically subwoofers that shake the object they are attached to instead of moving air when attached to furniture you replace the bass sound with a (near) silent vibration i got a buttkicker gamer 2 late last year and while i love how i can feel explosions in movies or being shot at in games you always feel like you are in the middle of the action i started wondering if there was a way to improve the immersion it offered i wanted a better appreciation for off-screen explosions i wanted to be able to react to games when i was *almost* being shot what i was asking for was a stereo tactile experience as far as i can tell no one really makes this for consumers so i went to a few stores and ended up building a 21 tactile transducer experience you can watch my explanation and demo of it here: [https://youtube/8v\_42ygivyw](https://youtube/8v_42ygivyw) the wiring is simple: audio jack -> splitter -> to two rca cables -> two separate amps -> to speakerwire -> to transducers on my pc i have a sound card that allows me to plug the two transducers into a shared left and right channel and the buttkicker into my sub channel the video shows how i made it but it doesnt really do the experience justice also i built mine knowing i already have a buttkicker gamer to use as the ""01"" channel but had i not had one i could have left it out and the experience would still be quite immersive or i could have used a 3rd transducer for the dedicated sub channel i watched die hard with a vengeance and the intro was simply amazing when i play call of duty or overwatch i now feel the direction to run oh and i can turn off my subwoofer and use this to watch movies or play games *at any time of the day* because there is no bass in the house to bother anyone [testing a 20 tactile experience on my ipad](https://ireddit/9eo9pmojvdl31png) parts: 2 x aurasound ast-2b-4 pro bass shaker tactile transducer 2 x nobsound g2 subwoofer amplifier & mono power amp stereo speaker wire 35 mm to stereo rca mono splitter 2 x rca cable a wooden serving tray with curved handles plywood 8 screws with bolts and washers 15 inch thick foam felt fabric fabric adhesive spray hand saw",0

weatherstripping on doorstop hi diyers my back door has been suffering from what i believe to be poor construction the door itself doesnt actually make contact or come very close to the doorstop outside as such its hard to seal the door with weatherstripping on the hinge side the door appears to be compressing the weatherstripping adequately however on the handle side the door is barely coming in contact with the weatherstripping so its not creating a good seal i used the vinyl covered foam bulb stripping as can be seen in the linked images my question is how should i fix this should i use a larger bulbed weatherstripping should i replace the doorstop if so do i need to replace it on all sides of the door ive never replaced a doorstop before so any guides or advice would be greatly appreciated [more edit: added another album did i install the stripping incorrectly is it supposed to go in the groove between the doorjamb,0

"basement insulation questions hi all i live in nh and have some questions about basement insulation before we begin here are a few photos of the basement: as some additional background: the cement walls of the basement start about 2-3 feet above grade behind the gray plywood door are the stairs to the cellar doors (which are the standard metal cellar doors) theres no insulation on the plywoodtheres also no insulation between the basement and first floor i do need to keep the basement above freezing because thats where all the water stuff is and there is a heating element stretching about a quarter of a long wall and a thermostat for the basement im looking for suggestions for best bang-for-my-buck for insulation i am aware that nh has a program that will pay 1/2 the cost of any insulation upgrades done by a professional up to $4k after a $100 inspection but you need to have 12 months of utility bills (which i dont have yet) and there are certain requirements for the amount you have to spend to heat during the winter (im not sure what those are however) id rather not spend an excessive amount on heating this winter if there are a couple simple changes that i can make especially ones where it will end up being far cheaper to diy than hire a professional so there are a few areas that i was considering - 1 replace the plywood door with a normal insulated steel door i cant imagine that the plywood has any real r-value and a prehung steel door should be fairly easy to install not sure if this is worth the upgrade so i figured that id ask 2 replace/fill the empty rim joist spaces insulation its currently fiberglass ive heard that this is no longer recommended/not nearly as effecient as other methods however im not sure what method is best ive heard both: (a) cut foam board to fit and spray foam the gaps around the edge and (b) spray foam the rim joist the only issue i have with pure spray foam is that ive had to replace a couple areas where there were doors so i kinda want to keep those accessible if there are issues in the future ive also heard that i have to get the foil-backed foam board if i want to go that route suggestions the internet seems to have different opinions depending on the site im also not sure how much better that will be than it is currently 3 begin the process of insulating the walls via rigid foam i""m not sure on the best method on this or whether its really worth it i would imagine that it would be for the section above grade at least and id rather look at just doing the foam board rather than build a whole 2x4 wall but im open to suggestions 4 anything else i missed if im insulating the walls do i really need to be concerned about the spaces between the joists between the basement and the first floor i do currently seem to have quite a few spiders in the basement (yuck) and am hoping better sealing will eliminate that problem my last place had a red-squirrel and mouse problem (yuck-est) so im not eager to introduce any elements which would be attractive for rodents/would not be easy to remove and replace if necessary i havent seen a squirrel or mouse here yet thank god but definitely want to keep in mind their love of fiberglass and the need to exterminate any which do make it into the house",0

light bulb help hi we bought a house about 5 years ago and a bulb in the basement just died so i need to buy a replacement and im unsure what to get when i removed the bulb the sticker on the fitting said max 75w r30 par30 and max 65w br30 the current 8 bulbs (4 on 2 switches) are par38 75w/120v halogen that i am struggling to find exact replacements for so i thought i should go for led if i have to replace them all but when i bought 4 par38 led i couldnt get them to dim properly these are par38 15w (100w equivalent) i read that the problem might be the dimmer so i bought the recommended dimmer with this switch i can set how dim i want the dimmest setting in the slide switch to be the problem i am having is that when i set the level to actually be dimmed the lights wont turn on each time and to get them to turn on each time i have to set the dimness to a level that isnt actually dim i think i must be doing something wrong but im unsure what if i cant get led bulbs of the right size to dim ill just buy a new set of halogen any advice would be greatly appreciated,0

"how to bring ethernet to a room across the hall in rented apartment i moved into a new rental the fiber optics outlet is in the middle of the living room right next to the swisscom dsl+phone plug but i need ethernet the most in the office across the hall wifi and powerline are not an option because theyre too unreliable and only provide a couple hundred megabits at best i cant drill or alter the walls in any way because theyre freshly painted and im not sure ill be able to patch them up and find matching color paint to complicate things they painted over wallpaper i guess to give the paint some kind of texture id rather avoid doing anything to the walls there are several panels in the ceiling which i assume are the points where electrical cables meet i havent opened these panels yet to look because theyve been painted shut and i dont want to open them and damage the paint if not necessary in the room that shares a wall with the office there is a plug labeled t+t which i assume is another swisscom plug on the wall in the hallway there is a t+t panel which im guessing is ""telegraph + telephone"" and which i suppose is the point where the swisscom cables come in from the outside ive thought of a few way i could bring ethernet to the room: 1 i could pull a 15 meters long fiber cable from the outlet to the office that would involve going around and across 4 doorways i might be able to tuck the fiber behind the baseboards (which are screwed on conveniently rather than nailed) but that still leaves me with several 90 degrees turns across the doorways which i dont think the fiber cable would take very well i also has to make it across a door and i suspect opening and closing a door over the fiber will eventually break it 2 i could somehow thread a fiber optics cable from the living room swisscom socket to the bedroom swisscom socket and then have the cable turn around the wall through a doorway to the office not a huge fan of this either because the cable would somehow have to make it across a door and i suspect the glass inside it might break from closing the door over it too much 3 fiber along the electrical lines there is power in every room and maybe fishing the cable through these wall plates all the way to a power outlet in the office would do the trick not sure how safe that is though because i know cables can act as wicks when there is a fire and spread the fire quicker 4 because im using a media converter anyway i could pass ethernet cable around instead of a fiber optics cable i want the router firewall etc to be in the office anyway so that could work i dont think passing it along the electrical wires would be safe but what about along the swisscom lines further questions i have are: - what really are these ceiling panels and that t+t panel - how hard or realistic is it to fish cables through existing conduits in the walls - if i cant fish cable through the walls what do you use to attach the cable along the walls without damaging the walls or baseboards when you remove it - is flat ethernet cable better or should i stick with round cable considering ill have corners to turn what i mean is there will be some turns that are 90 degrees along the same plane but there also will be turns that are 90 degrees across two planes: these are not a problem with round cables but they are with flat cable from what i can picture in my minds eye finally pictures:",0

"suggestions for repairing old basement walls i recently purchased a 110 year old house with a limestone block foundation and i am looking to ""clean-up"" the basement as best i can one way that i hope to do that is by repairing and patching the basement walls it appears that the limestone block foundation was originally coated with a thick covering its much thicker than plaster and i believe the term is parging over time the coating has cracked in places and even detached from the wall fortunately the majority of the coating is still present and seems to be very durable (ie not brittle) that means that i would ideally be able to repair the affected areas rather than replace the entire coating as i have not done this type of repair work before i am wondering what the best approach would be in my own research i have come across numerous products ranging from drylock to quickrete has anyone worked with these types of old basements before pictures are linked below",0

tumble dryer not heating correctly hi folks im having an issue with my hoover tumble dryer it spins fine and warms up slightly so i know the heater is working however it doesnt get hot enough to dry the clothes my wife religiously cleans all the filters so theres no issues with those ive checked all the temp sensors for resistance and they work as they should (the resistance decreased as i warmed them up) i checked the pressure sensor for the reservoir pump which also worked correctly (nothing on the meter until i blew into it mimicking water pressure) now there is a small hole in the rear plastic cover (i believe the heat is channelled through this cover into the drum): is it likely that the hole allows enough heat to escape so that the drum doesnt get hot enough so the heater tries to get hotter and trips the thermostat,0

"solutions for placing a patio table/chairs on an uneven rock surface i recently purchased a new house that has a seriously badass patio area that i am really looking forward to using however the floor is made of roughly-set rocks mortared together [here is a picture](https://iimgurcom/cepvexkjpg1) looks cool but will probably be terrible to have a patio table and chairs on because the chairs will get stuck on the rocks and will wobble because of the unevenness so i am trying to figure out a way to (reasonably inexpensively) remedy this problem without pulling up the rock floor for stationary furniture/grill i have no problem shimming the legs to get everything to sit level but i know it will be a problem with the patio chairs my first thought was to lay down a large rug but i think that chairs will still kind of get caught when getting pushed around and they certainly wont sit flat on all four legs without rocking so the second thought was maybe to get a couple bags of sand to spread out underneath the rug to basically ""fill"" the topography of the underlying patio rocks in a way that wont permanently ruin the patio floor but then i kind of figured that the sand would get washed away or would get pushed out from under the rug over time and then id still have the same problem any ideas are welcome thank you very much",0

"we went the diy route with our new countertops and are super happy about it we are in the middle of a kitchen renovation right now and although (eventually) we hope to go with granite or quartz countertops we did not want to drop the ~$5000 for new countertops after the contractor discount i would be getting because of my work instead after lots of research into cheaper options (which there are frustratingly few of) we decided to chance a go with epoxy countertops we debated on doing laminate but i just hate the inorganic look of laminate and the edge options are not my favorite i very much dislike the 90 discolored edges of laminate ive done concrete countertops before which we loved but the style didnt quite fit our new kitchen we also have a lot of countertop space and concrete would be very cumbersome to attempt overall it didnt fit our situation the pros: -very inexpensive -""natural""ish looking (with some artistic talent) -more natural rounded edges -waterproof -heat proof -scratch resistantcan also be buffed out if needed -not ""plastic"" feeling like most laminate -more diy friendly than concrete -if you mess up you can just buy some more epoxy and try again over it -different finish options -warmer feeling than stone the cons: -pretty steep learning curve with making it look ""real"" -messy when youre pouring the epoxy -some woodworking skills and tools required -edges arent perfect and can easily be messed up -still not real stone the costs: -$80 for epoxy -$25 for colored powder/primer -$25 for two sheets of partical board -$10 for mixing buckets -$10 wood glue -some other small misc stuff i already had first i made the base by measuring the shape i needed and cutting it out on the two sheets of partical board i clamped the two sheets together and then glued it after it was cut but i might have switched the two in hindsight after it was all cut and the right size i took a random orbital sander and gently rounded the corners and edges gotta protect little baby heads next i covered our entire kitchen in plastic do not skip this step the epoxy gets everywhere as it needs to drop off the sides to cover the edges i brought the base back inside set it up on the plastic covered island and got the epoxy ready i wont go into detail with mixing and pouring the epoxy as countertop epoxys website and youtube channel goes into depth on everything i will say that the thing that i learned (at least in our case and with the look we were going for) less color is more we wanted mostly white counters so the more color we added the harder it was to get back to white if we used too much we found that if there was an area we didnt like we could take a paint roller and roll over the spot we didnt like and it would make it pretty much go away youve got like an hour of working time before the stuff wont self level anymore another thing we learned is do not skimp on epoxy if the directions say you need a gallon of epoxy use a gallon if you go too thin it will start drying and leave these ""fish eyes"" or divots in the surface again watch their videos online for more after waiting a few days for it to cure and harden i took 320 grit sandpaper and buffed the whole thing with a random orbital sander to give it a matte finish and take away the shiny plastic look that epoxy can have if left alone some people like that look but we dont honestly it makes it look like real stone when its matte as opposed to shiny anyway all in all were really happy with them its obviously not real stone but for less than $200 we can always go with real stone after we save and want to drop the money honestly though i think it looks a lot like real marble we spent a lot of time in stone warehouses and it definitely looks like some of the slabs we liked it looks even better in person thanks for sticking with me through this novel here are some pictures too:",0

my first functional woodworking project - a 25$ pedalboard i dont really have a lot in terms of photos but [here](https://iimgurcom/i6u4ikejpg) is a pedalboard for my bass effect pedals i just finished i built it out of some pine planks and closet handles in my local public workshop it cost me about 15$ for supplies and about 10$ for workshop fees i stained it black and put velcro on the top to hold the pedals in place ([before the finish](https://iimgurcom/0icg4z3jpg)) its not much but im kinda proud of this one since its my first practical project that feels like its gonna serve me for a long time plus it saved me about 100+ bucks that steel pedalboards of this size go for where im from ive seriously enjoyed working with proper power tools so i hope i can share some cooler stuff as this hobby slowly turns into an obsession,0

help with storm door installation posted same on homeimprovement i guess no one over there has any input :( so hoping you guys/girls might be able to help me out with this> album of whats here now: having watched a few videos but having never had to install one of these it looks like the outer casing as you can see in the pics is going to be an issue and may be the reason why the previous owner (bought house 1 yr ago) has the current style door in there current door is almost purely decorative - provides almost 0 protection against the elements if you see in the pic how the decorative casing/trim bows out at the bottom - i dont see how im going to be able to attach the frame/jamb to this in i think the 2nd pic you can see how they added a piece to the rough opening to be able to affix the hinges on the current door id be able to attach this side if it werent for the fact that i want this door to be hinged opposite to the current one - for the reason that the hardware for the interior entry door is almost guaranteed to conflict with the hardware for the planned storm door we rarely use the front door as we enter from the back where the garage is so the inconvenience of having the 2 doors hinged opposite isnt an issue edit - after looking at this another minute i think im going to have to add a piece to the one side similar to the one thats already there where the current hinges are attached i really dont want to do this will require the door be smaller and weaker am i not seeing this whole thing the right way tia for any help and ideas,0

removing tile over hydronic radiant heating were in contract to buy a lovely house with hydronic radiant heat in the floors the house was built in 98 and the hydronic system itself is in good shape just covered with late 90s boring 8x 8 eggshell tile and pink carpets unfortunately the tile is the dominant floor covering of the 1580sqft house we could do laminant or another hard surface flooring over the existing tile but that double thick layering may impact warmth throught the house we thought of matching laminant to existing tile colors but that may only go so far in updating the interior design of the house has anyone pulled tile off over hydronic flooring before who can lend some advice,0

e27 socket with small outer diameter to replace e14 so i finally found a fitting lamp for my room but the problem is that it has e14 sockets since i already have e27 lamps bought i thought it might be possible to fit a bigger socket instead of the old one but all the e27 sockets i found have a bigger diameter than 45mm (about 18 inch) when looking into the sockets i noticed that they all have the actual thread in the middle a little gap and the outer wall ([imugrcom/isifpcj](https://wwwimugrcom/isifpcj)) so my question is if it would be possible to cut the outer wall and the little spacing brackets off in order to make it fit if you find any e27 sockets that are smaller in the first place they would be good too adapters are not an option since they add too much height,0

pvc pipe -- brittle will it survive this project i am thinking of using pvc pipe to construct something unusual and am wondering if it is worth the cost (\~$100) four 8 pillars of 2 inch pvc connected at the top using three-way pvc elbows then plywood on top of that why because in winter we have some large chunks of ice that slide off the roof right over our rear entry door so this would be to create a sort of protective overhead gizmo in case a chunk of ice (the size of a 50 lb sack of potatoes) came falling down to hit the protection instead of my head or shoulder do you think the gizmo would survive multiple hits during the winter or would the pvc shatter this would be in temperatures of even down to -20f or even -30f i dont want to pay $100 and my time constructing this if first time it shatters the past winter we wore our bicycle helmets but this winter coming up we have a new dog which likes to lie down right outside the door-- and it would be injured or killed by the falling ice blocks yikes so i am looking for a solution the section of roof above the area has a rubber membrane / rubber roof causing the ice to slide off from heat from the house (bungalow style house so there is no attic to insulate to make the roofing cold),0

what is this layer under the tiles the tilers have used it to raise the level of the tiles to match the height in the next room we have problems with other tiles in the building coming loose after a few months and i think its due to bad workmanship ive never laid tiles but from what i understand the adhesive should only be a thin layer and be in contact with the whole tile the tiles are 10mm so the layer is about 20mm and as you can see there are gaps underneath (some larger than the one in the picture) some advise/ opinions would be appreciated https://ireddit/4k9w8zdtyrk31jpg,0

help request- how can i make this shelf and make it sturdy hi guys we are trying to build [this for my daughters room she is 10 months old but walks and climbs on everything that she can so it needs to be very sturdy im just not sure how to assemble this so that it would be ive tried googling a million different terms but i must not be using the right one because i cannot find anything to help me im think that theres no way that the cylindrical legs go straight through the bottom shelf because theres no way that is sturdy enough if it did right so im thinking that maybe the cylindrical leg that actually rests on the floor is not actually connected to what separates the first and second level i dont know can anyone point me in the right direction on how you would build this specifically in regards to the cylindrical legs thanks,0

i removed ancient wall covering from my plaster bathroom walls how should i proceed my home was built in 1953 we are remodeling our bathroom there was an aluminum chair rail over a strange cork wall covering that had been painted over 5+ times i decided to peel the wall covering off and skim coat the wall before painting the covering came off pretty easily due to the glue being dried out but now i am left with the glue residue and a few small areas with cracking plaster the lathe is not visible or anything but i am concerned that if i use any sort of abrasion to remove the glue it will further damage the plaster any advice could i use gardz or something and skim coat over the glue what can i do to repair the crumbling plaster areas ive looked into this but im finding a lot of conflicting information another concern is that its a moist environment can you even skim coat over plaster in a bathroom basically ive gone too far to go back now and i need to figure out how to proceed thanks so much,0

question about replacing thermostats hi all we recently bought a house and wanted to change the thermostats out to nest or similar ones the ones we currently have are very basic and dont allow for pre-sets we had a mass-save person come out to replace them as they have a free service for it they looked at it and told us that we cannot use any other type of thermostat due to the wiring heres what it looks like behind the thermostat panel: &#x200b; &#x200b; https://ireddit/xu5w6crp5ok31jpg i am trying to figure out: 1 what type of pre-set thermostat we might be able to use (does anyone have or have had a thermostat similar to this one) 2 do we *need* to hire an electrician or is this something we can do ourselves &#x200b; i tried to post this to the other threads but couldnt figure out how to add a photo if this should go there please let me know &#x200b; update: hi everyone i want to thank you all for your help i came here thinking that it would be impossible to do this myself due to the conversation i had with the mass-save install person glad to see they were wrong ill post another update when i get this sorted assuming i dont die from an electric shock :),0

noodling through a large concrete planter diy ive been working on my backyard and want to incorporate a couple large statement-piece planters im thinking of planting trees in them or large perennials purchasing planters as big as im envisioning (at least 2-3 feet tall) is going to cost quite a bit for each planter and id like to make them out of concrete so i figured i could maybe diy-it ive found several tutorials on how to do this online for smaller concrete planters [there are molds](https://wwwamazoncom/dp/b07twff8sp/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_u_g8ecdb9m1gg6t) sometimes people [construct molds out of cardboard](https://wwwfarmhouseonboonecom/farmhouse-on-boone/diy-concrete-planter/) for larger ones youre usually stuck constructing wood templates to act as molds i want to avoid doing this with a little creativity i was hoping to use the concepts behind the tutorials for using molds but on a larger scale i want to take two plastic trash cans one large and one slightly smaller add strips of wood across the top of the smaller can to hold it in suspension within the larger can grease the concrete-facing sides of both cans with veggie oil to help the concrete not stick (read this on a tutorial) suspend the smaller one and then pour in the quikrete and let it cure (please see my crude diagram below) does this seem feasible would i need to fill the smaller trash can with dirt or sand to help ensure it doesnt bow in do you think ill be able to reuse the cans any ideas and thoughts would be appreciated https://ireddit/7hi5cqjb1ok31png,0

any ideas how this wall is constructed what am i drilling through trying to hang a tv arm on wall dividing my 3rd (top) floor apartment from next door i used a stud finder and detected metal at stud intervals (no electrical) all the walls in my apartment did this so i figured its metal studs when drilled the metal was kinda thin with plaster or a similar textured insulation behind it followed by more metal (15 in deep) i stopped at the second metal barrier pic--> whats behind the next piece of metal i dont want to drill into the next apartment but it seems a little thin for me to be that close i figured id punch through and use snaptoggle bolts but the wall looks solid with that plaster/insulation substance any ideas how to attach the tv,0

can i replace the vent in my kitchen sink with a spout for filtered water i just moved into new construction and after we moved in the plumber had to come out to fix something i asked him what the thing coming out of the countertop next to my kitchen sink was and he explained that code required the plumbing under the sink to be vented he also said many people remove the vent and replace it with a soap or filtered water dispenser so they dont need to put another hole in their countertop our fridge doesnt have filtered water so i was thinking i would do as he suggested are there major problems ill cause by removing that vent from the vent a hose runes down to a spot just above the garbage disposal so my thought was that i would just cap and seal it there every other house ive ever lived in didnt have such a vent coming out of the counter so i welcome thoughts if im missing why it is important edit: thanks everyone for the feedback/comments i attached a couple of pictures but air gap for the dishwasher looks right based on what is under there you can see in the pictures at the link the grey hose coming from where the dishwasher is and the black hose running down from the air gap i probably misheard or it was the realtor that referred to it as a vent either way some useful feedback here and it sounds like i can remove it as long as i do it correctly my neighbor is a pretty handy dude so ill probably ask him for some help pics:,0

how do i mount a roof ledger for a patio cover i need to install a ledger board for mounting a patio cover this is the cover: [https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/palram-feria-10-ft-x-24-ft-white-patio-cover-awning-702726/204689136](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/palram-feria-10-ft-x-24-ft-white-patio-cover-awning-702726/204689136)  i cant mount it below the eaves because the eaves are too low for the minimum height of the patio cover (my house has low ceilings) i could cut the legs of the cover down to mount it directly below the eaves but it would make for a pretty low ceiling on the patio and would also void the warranty on the cover ive seen people in forums recommend mounting it to the fascia board but that doesnt seem strong enough its also maybe a moot point anyway because there is not enough space below the gutters there was previously a pergola mounted in the same position that a previous owner installed they just just nailed some 4x4s directly into the roof without any kind of flashing as mounts for the ledger you will be shocked to learn that water leaked through the nail holes i cant find photos of what i want to do other than this very expensive product that would have me make some pretty larges holes in my roof: [https://skylifthardwarecom/](https://skylifthardwarecom/) the manufacturer said i would need four of these mounts i also found these: [https://patioroofrisercom/product/patio-roof-riser/](https://patioroofrisercom/product/patio-roof-riser/)  pics of my beautiful patio in its current state: [https://iimgurcom/vzus0ocjpg](https://iimgurcom/vzus0ocjpg) [https://iimgurcom/f0reggvjpg](https://iimgurcom/f0reggvjpg) what is the cheapest yet structurally sound way to mount a ledger board to my roof that wont leak,0

is there any reason i shouldnt use mdf vs sanded plywood for a painted built-in closet hi r/diy a few months back i built an mdf built-in for my entry-way closet i primed and painted it semi-gloss white and i was very happy with the results now id like to create a similar built-in for my much larger bedroom closet the closet is 90 inches across and 84 inches tall but i plan to build 4 separate units and join them together at install - the largest of which will be 25 inches across would mdf be my best bet for this application i mainly want to use mdf because its cost effective but ive also worked with it before know how to paint it and its very flat and square the only downside i see is how heavy it is does it make sense for me to go with a 4x8 sanded birch or any other plywood for this project thanks for the advice i will certainly share pictures of the build,0

"question about building a base for a shed hello all you diy folks my wife and i recently bought one of those 8 x 12 prefab sheds from a box store the place we are looking to put it is on a slight decline so i was thinking about putting it on piers (as opposed to setting it on gravel) my question is in regards to how many piers to set my plan so far is to use 4x4 posts set below the frost line (42"" here in michigan) then string a 12 4x6 across the piers once thats in place i plan on using joist hangers to attach 2x6s level with the beams then throw some 3/4"" plywood down for the base and assemble the shed on top my question(s): a) does this plan make sense the shed will hold our riding lawnmower and some miscellaneous gardening stuff (pots hoses tomato cages etc) so i figure the joist hangers would be appropriate (as opposed to putting the 2x6 on top of my beams) b) assuming it does make sense how many/ and how far spaced should the 4x4 posts be can i get away with 4 total in an 8 square and cantilever the beams to get to 12 should i do 3 posts per side spaced at 5 with cantilevers 3 posts spaced at 6 should i do them every 4 any help/advice would be appreciated",0

tips/help: getting pyrite slate slips that will rust google not being my friend on this - because most people want to stop or remove the rust from their slate [example1](http://wwwsigaslatecouk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/rusting-slate-roof-2jpg) [example2](http://roomsandfloorscom/1233-large_default/split-face-multi-colour-rusty-slate-natural-stone-cladding-mosaic-tile-walljpg) [example3](https://wwwstonetilecompanycouk/media/catalog/product/cache/image/e9c3970ab036de70892d86c6d221abfe/s/t/stonetilecompany_black_slate_split_face_mosiac_tiles_large1-_lifestylejpg) so what im trying to recreate is what you get in example 4 id like to start with blackish grey slate knowing that it can get rust stains if exposed to water this would not be in a bathroom as per example 4 id like to control the rust - basically paint it with coats water selectively ideally then there be some way to seal it to prevent further rust over time is this something thats doable what specifically am i looking for in a slate tile that means it would rust when exposed to water and air (as many try to sell themselves as this wont rust) what could i use to later seal it when i have the effect im after some of the other examples (2) the slate is already rusted or (3) doesnt rust when it comes rusted the overall effect is too mottled for my tastes appreciate any advice from someone who knows about the geology/chemistry needed here and/or worked on something similar edit: to clarify this is for an interior fireplace breast,0

finding damp source my back wall is damp and cold is there a way to find exactly where it is coming from no obvious leaks i have a dehumidifier but that doesnt really help the best it can do is get down to 50 humidity running it all day but next day it has climbed significantly again usually is above 80 i have ordered a moister detector there is a repaired bit of wall on the outside which looks intact but who knows and maybe cement that has deteriorated from between the bricks around the same area could that be it the wall feels colder/damper down low was thinking about getting that masonry sealant stuff can i put that on the inside or just outside no wallpaper just painted wall (due to wallpaper getting black mould all the time) i have noticed when i sleep in another part of the bedroom i dont wake up with a blocked nose and can breathe better so this is affecting health but i dont have money for a professional - how do the pros do it is it an educated guess or do they have tools to identify the source definitively when there is no really obvious cause any advice,0

"shed is finally finished tldr: it only took 9 years &#x200b; https://ireddit/f1acbrmj2ik31jpg weve all had those projects that started out planned with excitement but over time become a running joke or constant reminder that you lack the resources skills or time needed to complete what once made you so passionate im telling you if i can finally complete the worst part of waking up on the weekend you can too it really doesnt matter how long it takes the feeling of completing a project after years of procrastination lack of time or even hard times is even more exhilarating than completing a project on time and under budget you can finish it october 2009 i purchased my first starter home in a new neighborhood under development while it was only studs i came by every day after work to check out the progress pick out colors decide on tile etc but most importantly plan landscaping which included my first shed on my own land i had printed out plans for a [kit from home depot](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/handy-home-products-phoenix-10-ft-x-8-ft-solar-shed-with-floor-kit-18160-3/100350467) that was half shed and half greenhouse but unfortunately the glass part was on the 8 foot side of a 8x10 floor kit where i wanted the glass on the 10 foot side of a slab the house was completed in december 2009 and i moved in in the months leading up to moving day i had redesigned the home depot shed to suite my needs but retain the same set of building instructions and materials just dimension changes for walls and trusses (and the addition of anchor bolts) i had everything i needed to start construction on my dream shed come spring then i met my wife in january it wasnt her fault my priorities changed i did manage to pour the slab in may of 2010 with the help of my future wife as a date sort-of thing pouring the slab was the hardest i had ever worked (im a computer guy im handy but still a computer guy) i ordered a palette of cement bags rebar 2 yards of red sand for leveling and timber for the forms a friend of mine showed up to help set up the forms and happened to have a laser leveler and had the amazing idea to raise the form to the level of the foundation of my house i highly recommend doing this every time ive gotten a little bit of flooding in the back yard im thankful he had that idea i rented an electric mixer that fit 2 bags of cement at a time and started pouring for years afterwords id pull out the shed plans about once a month make notations check prices make minor changes the slab ended up becoming a pedestal for our picnic table for cookouts i felt i didnt have the time money or skill set to complete the shed family just happens our resources were shifted to a wedding to car repairs to children it just happens and years flew by people would ask about the slab and id have to explain my idea for the shed sometimes pulling out all my plans and notes to show them again the excitement i knew id get to it eventually but again things happen and years flew by five years later: may 2015: i knew i had a work bonus coming up in june and as an added bonus the final house of our planned neighborhood was under construction i had made friends with the contractor at this point and got the ok to pick their scrap pile i was able to build the walls and roof trusses to my modified design flat on the floor of my garage for just the cost of a pack of exterior screws the plan was now to erect the skeleton of the shed and use the work bonus to complete it that weekend i was able to erect the walls and trusses with the help of my neighbor the next weekend i was able to add the plywood roof base and cement anchors i picked a stack of 1x4s for the trim but it would have to wait until i could purchase the shed paneling a week later i got my bonus and picked up a bunch of sheets of shed paneling roofing fabric shingles and roofing tacks i was able to mount the paneling the trim and the shingles that weekend also that weekend the ac coil in my house broke no more work bonus the only thing i could afford the next weekend was 1 gallon of white exterior paint to try and protect the skeleton of the shed because i had no idea when i would be able to continue the shed just sat like that with just the trim painted and half exposed for another 4 years every time id get another bonus or raise my savings or get a tax return or surprise payout from somewhere something bad would happen the same weekend im not exaggerating id save up the funds to finish the shed and boom car breaks down badly next time: my dog gets hit by a truck next time: wife trips over the three legged dog and breaks a front tooth in half next time: daughter totals the new car (all of these happened all at when i was planning to finish the shed all of which cost thousands of dollars) it became a running joke in my family ""do you think our house would ever burn down"" ""about the same time im ready to finish my shed"" my wife and i were literally scared to receive a lump of money because it always ended badly well i was able to eventually finish my shed heres how it happened june 2019: my office got a new contract for a large installation and the customers were really demanding they wanted all the work done in 30 days i rode with the sales team (i being lead engineer) to meet with the new customer on the 45 minute drive my boss asked about my shed i explained everything that was going wrong whenever i was ready to finish it and how it haunted my dreams he told me ""if you can get this done on time ill give you a bonus to finish your shed"" immediately i was petrified ""you cant do that"" i said ""something bad will happen"" he changed his tactic to ""alright ill buy everything you need to finish your shed if you can get this project done in 30 days"" alright that works we shook on it july 2019: work project done i knew a lot of the wood on the exposed side was rotten had the boss-man order me a lot of extra 2x4s to graft into good pieces and replace the rot along with this was all the pieces i needed to complete my shed this included [sheet plexi](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/lexan-thermoclear-48-in-x-96-in-x-1-4-in-clear-multiwall-polycarbonate-sheet-pctw4896-6mmcl/205202473) [foam

[mounting bolts](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/2-in-fastener-for-16mm-thermoclear-multiwall-sheet-85190128/206935863) more 1x4 trim paint silicone calk acrylic calk wood filler [plexi sheet connectors](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/2-in-x-96-in-x-5-8-in-thermoclear-polycarbonate-multi-wall-h-channel-pctwh-16mm/205202545) flashing drip edge quarter round for window trim more shed paneling plywood (to build my own door) door hinges latches door handle simple vent covers and probably other stuff i cant remember right now completing this shed was always on my mind and every month id go asses the weather damage and keep a running list in my head of what i would need to complete it so when it was time to square up with my bosss offer i was ready a week later a flat bed showed up at my house with more than everything i needed i started by ripping away all the rotted wood and carefully grafting in good wood i painted the finished grafts to seal them from the elements with high quality exterior paint and primer august 2019: i cut the 4x8 plexi into 2 strips and used the connectors to assemble them into a 10x7 sheet that slid directly into place with the seams centered on the roof trusses i layd a bead of construction adhesive on the bottom inch of the sheet and bolted in the 3""x3"" drip edge at the bottom i sealed the edge with silicone calk with a left over strip of 2 wide plexi i cut and mounted a window on the far side opposite the door and trimmed it with quarter round (sealing it with silicone calk) a storm was coming so i quickly had to mount the side flashing/drip edge and seal it before the rain my shed was now covered the next weekend i fabricated a door i cut the plywood to shape and covered it with wood paneling adhered with construction adhesive i framed it with 1x4 trip and screwed it all together i painted the trim for protection until i could get to the main paint i mounted the door against 1""x1"" door jams that i nailed into place i attached the door hardware my shed was now totally sealed september 1st-3rd 2019: paint and vents done its still hard to believe its finished it took so much out of me for the past 9 years that i still wake up feeling like theres something im supposed to be planning but for the first time i can walk out back in with my coffee and realize i dont have anything to do (as far as the shed is concerned) sorry for the long post im just extremely overcome with the feeling of accomplishment we plan on starting plugs in the greenhouse this spring and transplanting them in our new garden

vent hood support hi all my wife and i are trying to install a vent hood over the rangetop in our kitchen the vent hood insert we selected secures into a structure and not directly into the wall (big mistake) as a result right now we have a support frame built with 2x4s but my wife is concerned with how far it is jetting out wondering if the diy community has any suggestions on how we might be able to approach a thinner support structure so as to reduce how far the vent hood will come out from the wall the hood secures with screws from the front and sides of the unit ive done quite a bit of research but cant see to find any simple suggestions other than the 2x4 construction so would appreciate any thoughts we are installing a zephyr monsoon 1 insert thanks edit: added proposed design &#x200b; https://ireddit/7h19sa84shk31jpg &#x200b; &#x200b; [proposed design](https://ireddit/xqspr6xeaik31png),0

need recommendation for hardware i am looking to make outdoor blinds to block wind and i could use some recommendations on hardware since i dont know what i need is called im struggling to find it (if it even exists) what i want to do is use sun shade fabric and attach rollers to each side every 6 inches or so these rollers would fit into a track on either side of the blinds that would keep them from moving in the wind im struggling to find the track and rollers i considered using t-channel (like what many 3d printers use) but i dont think it will slide well enough whatever i use needs to be relatively element proof (though there will be a roof above it but the sides will be exposed to any windblown rain pine needles etc) something that utilizes ball bearing wheels in a track would be pretty ideal though id need it to have some sort of base that i can sew to the fabric can anyone recommend any products that would fit the bill for this id love any links that you think may work since it will give me a good starting point a note on the posting rules: im **not** necessarily looking for a specific place to purchase a product im trying to find out what product would work for this specific purpose i hope that this is within the rules thanks,0

roof mount an antenna is it safe i need a little guidance back story i cut cable tv out of my life and have gone with a very small omni-directional air antenna i had read that it is important that you dont mount the antenna until youve tested various locations on your roof to identify where you get the best signal strength and then mount the antenna to date since i move the antenna quite a bit i made a plywood platform and mounted the antenna to that im ready to permanently mount the antenna but im worried about drilling into my roof i have found plenty of videos explaining how to roof mount antennas but just because you can do this doesnt mean you should im asking people wiser than i: should i roof mount the antenna get a non-penetrating roof mount mount to the fascia or something i havent thought of thank you,0

"looking for thoughts re: a leaky a/c unit hey everyone - ill try to format this post well and keep it as brief as possible our a/c unit (located in the basement) has leaked before causing the basement area to flood i tried several things to fix it (flushing the system cleaning etc) and i thought i *finally* fixed it when i installed a u-trap (im sure thats not the official term) last summer; however it leaked and flooded the area again recently here are some things that are worth pointing out: removing [this reveals the coils etc the unit does not leak when this panel is off - it only leaks when it is in place when attempting to put the panel in place the airflow really sucks it in [heres where the unit is dripping](https://gfycatcom/shorttermenchantingbilby) thats far less of a drip than we *were* experiencing; however its still concerning me we had our fourth hvac technician visit today no one could seem to figure out why the unit was dripping prior to the final visit this drip was *much* worse whenever that panel was re-installed in this particular gif you can see it leaking just a bit the last guy to pay us a visit kept saying ""something in your house *has* to have changed in order to cause this something with your air ducts"" despite me telling him that we havent had any work done and havent done anything to the house he kept adamantly stating that ""something must have been done"" his explanation was that the airflow was too powerful and that its sucking water back inside from the drain pipe when i asked him why that would have happened recently he again said ""its because something has to have changed in your house"" that technician did his best to solve the problem he re-cleaned the system cleaned the coils flushed the pipes (as i had done) etc he finally [opened this [inserted this piece of pvc pipe into the other and [opened up a back panel on the a/c unit](https://gfycatcom/snivelingdesertedantelopegroundsquirrel) he said that all of this was necessary to allow the unit the draw air in from other places so as to not pull water in from the drain pipes [he inserted an extra piece of pvc into one of the sockets on the he wrapped up by saying ""your unit may continue to drip but the air should suck all of the water up i still dont know why this would be happeningsomething must have changed in your house"" so in conclusion heres what im facing: i installed a u-trap and ive flushed the system numerous times this includes attaching a shop-vac to the end of the drain-line and pouring water into the drain pan when the aforementioned panel is not attached there is no water drippage; however when it **is** attached water seems to drip almost right away several experts basically said ""sorry we have no idea whats causing this"" and the last one said its a problem with the power of the airflow and that something has **clearly** changed in our house even though nothing has anywayim just wondering if anyone has any ideas drain-line is clear and uncloggedcant notice any rusted holes in the drain pancoils are cleanetc etc would love any thoughts about what might be stumping all of us =p",0

filling in and compacting dirt after patio removal - help i just moved into a house where the previous owner had a poorly installed patio our goal was to remove all the gravel and plant grass i finally shoveled out all of the gravel (around 10ft x 10ft - 6-8in deep) and proceeded to fill the hole back in with dirt/screened top soil how should i go about compacting this soil so that it doesnt sink when i walk on it ive tried a lawn roller but it doesnt seem to do enough would a plate compactor work better im worried if i just plant grass as-is then it will be a muddy disaster when it rains and ill leave huge foot prints if i walk through it while its wet,0

i messed up cutting a basic service cart now its sagging severely on one end how can i fix it im using a basic harbor freight steel service cart to hold a forge the forge sits up top and on the bottom theres an electric blower i cut a hole into the side walls of the cart for the blower tube thinking they werent entirely structurali was wrong now the corner behind the hole i cut (which is right behind one of the casters) is sagging im now extremely concerned about the overall stability against tipping over especially as the sagging side of the cart is substantially more loaded than the non sagging side because of a very heavy pipe that comes down from the side i tried to add some support by connecting a chain in between two j-hooks one on the sagging side and the other on the top diagonally across doesnt seem to have done anything though and ive tightened it significantly here are two pictures the first shows the sag and the second the chain i attached to try to counter it: * https://drivegooglecom/file/d/12r_yudrcy8ggao9cbzpylvyujejwve27/viewusp=drivesdk * https://drivegooglecom/file/d/12ua3nn-nlrbu6rq_2de_sclle9musq4m/viewusp=drivesdk my only other idea is to take a length of steel (about a quarter of an inch thick) and bolt it underneath the cart from the sagging end back to past where i made the cut any further ideas or advice would be most appreciated,0

mod ryobi 18v radio hey everyone i was just curious if anyone has done or attempted to add a switch to the usb charging port on the p742 ryobi 18v bluetooth radio the reason i ask is that when you have the battery pack plugged in there is a constant drain on the battery whether or not there is anything connected to the usb port there is only two wires going into it: white (5v) and black (ground) that goes from the board to the usb port i was going to cut one of the wires and solder a switch in series from the board to the usb port thinking about it the mod still will not solve the problem of the constant drain the only thing the switch will do is let me charge a device or not but the parasitic drain would still continue i realize that i would have to go further up into the circuit i would not know how to trace the board or what to look for it would be nice to be able to leave the 18v battery in and not worry about a dead battery when i come back to use the radio after several days apparently it is a known issue with the current radio and previous (non-bluetooth) radio can anyone help thanks,0
need advice on a lateral opening panel hey everybody i was looking for some reccomendations on a lateral opening panel for some background im about to remodel my kitchen my breaker panel is located in a closet pantry inside my kitchen currently i know it needs to move down about 6 inches or so in order to fit the new cabinets that will be above it that puts it in the middle of my backsplash i saw a gif a while ago of someone who used this kind of access panel and then tiled over it so it was completely hidden my googling shows these panels ranging from $45 to $250 just thought i would check here and see if anyone else has done anything like this and can reccomend a product thanks,0
best power tool to cut fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together hello im renovating a fiberglass waterfall fixture for a friend and would like to cut out a hole at the back of the fixture so i can access the pump and wiring more easily this would be about 8x8 inches once done i want to glue it back in to avoid water droplets leaking out im looking for recommendations on the best tool to cut the fiberglass and best adhesive to glue it back together for this particular case the cut-out section is thankfully not in the path of the flowing water but i suspect that it is close enough to the base where the water falls that some water may occasionally splash back over to this section im away from home and in another country so my choice of power tools are limited i have access to a drill gun (can borrow) and a angle grinder (can rent) would the angle grinder be the better choice if so what disc size and type should i look for &#x200b; if i may add another requirement/complication - is there a way to convert this cut-out into a door or make it easy to reopen in the future in case of repairs what would be the best way to go about this im imagining a tiny hinge at the back but cant think of how i would make the edges water proof if it helps the fiberglass structure is cylindrical in shape and stands at about 35 feet,0
concrete mix for diy hearth ive been wanting to experiment with diy concrete projects and i have an opportunity to as i am installing a freestanding natural gas stove in my living room this fall that will need a hearth for it to sit on when i see people making concrete tables and countertops many of them are using a specific concrete countertop mixture i am wondering if anyone has used other mixtures or has any recommendations this slab will be about 3 feet square and should not have much traffic or use after it is put in place the stove is around 100 pounds i am fine with regular gray concrete color but one of my roommates wants to experiment with dyeing the concrete my concerns are cost and availability at the local home center (home depot as well as local hardware stores and lumberyards) i know the speciality countertop mixtures are labeled as higher psi ratings and crack resistance good flow and quicker cure time and i think finer aggregate if anyone has a suggestion for an off the shelf bagged concrete or any other thoughts that would be greatly appreciated,0

trying to fix doorbell so my doorbell stopped working and i checked all of the common culprits (to the best of my ability) and none of those seemed to be the issue i checked the cables coming from the transformer (by sticking multimeter probes into the wire nuts coming from the transformer) and got a reading that seemed to indicate the transformer was not the issue i checked the striker to see if it was stuck but no it was fine the doorbell itself is a very basic run of the mill plastic piece with a light up button however the button was no longer lighting up (which is why i initially thought transformer) and when i removed the doorbell and rubbed the cables together nothing happens also when i place the multimeter probes on the wires that were hooked to the doorbell i get an extremely faint reading (like 01)  is there anything i am overlooking is it possible that we hung a picture or something and damaged the wiring in the wall running from the doorbell to the transformer also is there any easy technique to checking and replacing the wires without having to tear into the wall/ceiling this doorbell is on the front door and the transformer is in the rear of the house by the water heater and furnace i live in a townhouse happy to provide any other info that might help determine the cause and best fix thanks for any guidance,0
ungrounded three prong outlets i was painting a room this weekend and saw an outlet was broken i went to replace it i realized that it was a three-prong outlet that had no grounding wire connected to it a quick investigation revealed that none of the outlets in the room were grounded one outlet had a sticker saying gfci protected outlet but i dont think that was the case as the breaker in the box for that room is just a regular one in past houses when ive had a basement the actual breaker was gfci protected and that protected all the outlets on that circuit my house is definitely old (1950) and some areas do have legitimate two prong ungrounded outlets but this took me by surprise short of rewiring the room (eventually) can i simply change the breaker to a gfci protected one,0

how to properly cut foam for diy ocarina case hello everyone i recently bought a [ceramic ocarina](https://musiquedeterrefr/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/traversier-c3-bjpg) and i want to make a custom hardcase for it since i cant find one that i actually like (both strong and not too big so i can also bring it with me when traveling) i decided i want to make a wooden case with foam but i have never worked with it before and i have some questions: 1 how thick should the top/bottom foam parts be also how much foam should leave at the sides (since i intend to cut the shape of the ocarina in a thicker foam that goes in the middle) 2 should i try to create a concave shape somehow on the foam to perfectly adapt to the ocarina or is it too much work that wont necessarily make it better 3 can i just use regular flat foam everywhere or would it be better if i used egg crate shaped foam thanks in advance and sorry if this is the wrong place to ask about it,0

help w/pantry shelves *skip to end for short question* i have a pretty small closet pantry in my kitchen it had those really flimsy wire shelves originally that would sag with only one cans weight we also got a roommate and need another shelfand be able to store more than a few things on each so i ripped them out and all of the anchors and screws and brackets my initial plan was to buy a heavy duty wire shelving rack and build it insideso i did i bought a 36 w 16 d 72 h 5 shelf rack however who ever built my house decided that making my pantry 35 1/2~ wide was good enough instead of going for the standard 36 inches so after so much headache and chaos and searching for shelves to fit (there are none) i decided i had to make my own i went to multiple places but ended up at lowes found the only wood they had that was 16 across (need that depth in my pantry for sure) its only about 3/4 thick but it was my only choice the boards only came in 8 so rather than create a lot of waste and spend more money than i had i had them cut each piece into 3 pieces of 32 i dont really know anything about building shelves or using anchors or brackets or drilling pilot holes or staining woodi didnt really know what most of those things even meant before today i wasnt even sure i owned the correct tools but here we are i put the bottom shelf in the boards are a little bit warped but not too bad i put the anchors in correctly (the only stud in that closet is in the corner) i put the brackets in correctly drilled pilot holes in the boards using the correct size etc butttt it just really doesnt feel that sturdy i mean its sturdier than the terrible rubbermaid wire shelves for sure but idk id put a few jars on it i guess near the back but i definitely wouldnt sit on it or plop my kitchenaid mixer on it question: is there something i can do to support the front/sides a little more even though the edges of the shelf dont touch the walls on either side i really want it to be aesthetically pleasing in the end (or as aesthetically pleasing as a pantry can look considering these circumstances) [here are some pics of the shelf (holes are from all the old shelf brackets) grrr ](https://mimgurcom/a/ffgvxom) thanks in advance the last two days have been so frustrating and idk what im doing,0

how do i fix my sink hello guys i live in a student residency and i broke my sink with a falling cup (nothing happened to the cup) this is how it looks:  i saw fake videos of people fixing it with noodles but jokes aside do you guys know how it can be fixed i struggled to get out the broken piece from the sink so glueing it is most likely a no go i suppose then that the only way to do it is by putting some hardening material inside of it any advice will be helpful https://ireddit/ogwr41udhck31jpg,0

awesome house features that are easy to add while building/refurbishing (maybe asked before but this is really hard to google for) which features are easy/cheap/worthwhile to incorporate while building/refurbishing a house but will be really hard/costly to add later typically things youd need to open the walls for for example: - wiring (ethernet/power/speakers or ideally conduits) everywhere is the #1 almost impossible to overdo - underfloor heating but there are much less obvious ones how about: - dumbwaiter - full elevator shaft should you ever have trouble scaling stairs and need to put in a lift - hidden power sockets in middle of your big rooms - hot water faucet outside (washing car dog) - hidden safe in hallway - [pest control features](https://wwwpestmagazinecouk/media/619784/pests-and-buildings-an-acheta-guide-jul-18pdf) - piping to recycle roof water to flush your toilets with anything come to mind whats the best thing youve seen on a house everybody should have,0

wanted to make a safer play area for my son $180 in rubber mulch and 4 hours later started by having a landscaper take out these [two overgrown bushes taking up too much space](https://iimgurcom/02vksfcjpg) then we took a stake with a nail in it put it in the corner of the yard attached a string to it and created a radius once we marked out the radius with a shovel we [ripped up our freshly laid grass with a shovel and rake](https://iimgurcom/i9r3ph4jpg) it took 27 bags of cedar red rubber mulch (shredded tires) that we dumped and raked by hand to create the [(mostly) finished product](https://iimgurcom/umxpoodjpg) my neighbors fence is shot and need to be torn down but she selling the house so i just threw up some extra posts to fill that hole for now the last thing left is to put some garden edging around it to keep the rubber in one area all in all it was $180 worth of mulch and an afternoon my son loved it and its much softer than regular mulch,0

help with gfci and two circuits hi all ive been trying to make this gfci plug work but there seems to be a missing piece to the equation that i dont understand theres two sets of hot wires black and red only one neutral wire white theres a hot side and a side that goes through the switch box where the switches for the bathroom lights are from that box it continues on downstairs if i plug my one set of red cables into the gfci it works fine with the lights and downstairs all is good for that circuit however the other circuit (black) if i tie it together at both ends trips the gfci if i plug my 2 sets of black cables into the gfci (load and line respectively) again it works fine and goes downstairs but if i try to connect the red ends together it shorts or trips the gfci how can i get my gfci to work and still maintain the wiring so it can continue on downstair i suspect i have to tie something to the neutral but i dont know what,0

"custom marshall tube combo build i have had a marshall haze 15w tube head and a peavey valvestate 112 combo that have both been sitting around collecting dust for a couple of years we are moving soon as we had plenty of lead time on the move we have been clearing out old stuff i thought to sell the two amps the idea of combining the haze and valvestate cabinet came to me one less thing to move and use it while my big mesa is packed so i figured it would be worth a try as there wasnt mush wiring which isnt my strength it came together easily and only required two spots of solder to connect the cable to the speaker as the amp has a 1/4"" plug in for a single 16ohm which is what i used a warehouse guitar veteran 30 - 12"" i flipped the valvestate cabinet to accommodate the marshall amp as that was oriented tubes up redrilled some mounting holes and reused the hardware from the head enclosure glued on two black tabs to the amp face to close the gap to the edge of the cab found an old school looking marshall plate on ebay and i have an awesome little custom marshall tube combo amp that said if you know of a foot pedal for a haze 15 i would be interested msg me i cant find one thx",0

weber genesis propane grill repair - huge yellow flames got my hands on a used weber genesis e-330 (knobs on front) propane grill that is in fairly good shape but has some issues main issue is that instead of normal blue flames im getting huge massive yellow flames coming out ive cleaned out the burners and they appear to be in good shape tank itself is fine as it works normally on a different lp grill have tried resetting the built-in safety valve on the propane tank using methods found online played with the air shutters which did help adjust the intensity of the flames but even the best possible adjustment is still far from normal i looked up the serial # and it appears this was originally converted from a natural gas model so perhaps something wasnt done properly when it was converted at this point i am thinking either (a) something needs to be cleaned or adjusted that i havent thought of yet or (b) whoever did the conversion did a poor job and didnt do it properly any suggestions of what i can check out to figure out the issue my thought from here is possibly the manifold maybe they never changed it when they converted it or something is faulty with the existing one unfortunately i havent had any luck getting in touch with the prior owner if he was even the one who converted it in the first place if it matters im located in the us thanks,0

shared wall from hell - what to do hey guys a new neighbor moved in taking over from the quiet spinster who resided there for the last several years my new neighbor likes watching movies at times i can only characterize as holy s**t now im a light sleeper and losing my mind building is from the 30s or 40s i believe if that gives any insight into what sorts of materials were working with i asked the landlord to intervene or potentially spray some foam in the walls and he said theyre not paying for anything i dont have a ton of money to throw at this problem but i was thinking of laying some foam insulation (these: https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/207168829) over the wall and then making a shiplap out of reclaimed wood to go over it i would put some thin 1/2x2x8 runners along the studs the foam panels in between then the shiplap anchored to the runners does this seem like a sound plan any pitfalls i should avoid any alternate materials that would perform better that wont jack the budget up astronomically thanks in advance all help desperately needed sort of at my wits end update: spoke w/ neighbor again today decided that the first logical step is to float his tv from the wall we dont share a wall but given that the walls are probably damn near hollow its probably using them as a reverb chamber so were going to put a piece of rubber between the tv and the mounting bracket then some acoustic panels between the tv and the wall,0

an attempt at diy mold removal leads to a stinkier houseuh oh i have an old (\~100 yr old) house with rubble foundation (\~1600 sq feet mostly two story) located in new england the first floor had a hardly noticeable mildew-y smell that came from the basement the basement especially had this smell and im still confident for reasons to be shared below that the smell originates from the basement there is a dehumidifier running 24/7 in the basement and usually registers in the 30%s pretty good in this basement was a giant moldy plywood diy shelf / wall personally i think it was pretty thoughtless of the previous owner to put such a good food source for mold down in the basement i demolished and threw into a rented dumpter the entirety of that plywood/2x4 two days ago (saturday) then yesterday (sunday) in a full tyveck suit and mold mask i sprayed a \~20% bleach / water solution around where the plywood had been sitting and scrubbed / swept alot of the mess into a garabage bag and threw that into the dumpster as well i did this with the attached garage door open and a fan running in the basement after my diy remediation in the evening i closed the first floor windows and the garage door and let the fan run overnight to help dry out the basement we awoke this morning and now the house has a crazy strong musky smell luckily i suspect the bedroom must have been well sealed off as there was quiet a difference walking out into the hallway &#x200b; now our first floor really stinks though and im worried about the following: 1 ive spread mold to everywhere and now the whole sill of the house joists flooring etc will get moldy (though i think thats unlikelyhopefully) 2 that there is ***another*** source of mold which i cant find that i disrupted with the fan and blew around the house (even crawled around the crawl space mentioned below looking for other mold with a flashlight)  any thoughts or tips would be appreciated basement background: most of the basement is walking height with poured concrete floor and relatively well pointed walls not too bad never gets too wet down there though can get humid the kitchen of the house however sits on a rubble foundation with dirt floor but a vapor barrier sits above the dirt floor the sealing between the stone and plastic is far from perfect since i cant see it im worried about whats going on below the vapor barrier thanks for any help after reading this long post,0

led strip wiring hello ive posted about my project before but this seemed like a separate subject excuse me if i seem a bit amateurish my lights will be 75m in length run on 5v and draw 135a there will be about 5m of gap between various segments and to rejoin the far end to counter voltage drop given theres a +v gnd and data wire (which doesnt need rejoining) i need about 11m of wiring im supposing i could get a 3 core wire for the first half and a 2 core wire for the latter (sans data) ive calculated that id need 19 awg wires minimum could anyone confirm if that sounds right i wonder if the data wire will need the same rating i also wonder what the max length the lighting can be i assume the internal wiring within the led strip can only withstand so much thanks for reading i appreciate any and all advice counterintuitively the wiring is becoming the most expensive part,0
[help] kitchen island countertop workspace/cover hey /r/diy i have a nice kitchen in my apartment with a small square island but the island countertop is tiled whereas the rest of the counters are flat id love a flat space to work on the island (i cant do a lot of stuff id like due to the grout between the tiles) but im unsure of exactly how to approach this issue in the most cost-effective manner &#x200b; my main plan right now is to get some 1/2-3/4 in plywood/hardwood to prep for food safety and put rubber feet on so it fits over the original which would be about $25 &#x200b; if you have any other suggestions for this please let me know i think my plan now would work well but i may simply be missing something else that would work better or be cheaper id really like to do stainless steel but i know that isnt cost-effective or easy to obtain &#x200b; thanks,0

"advice on bathroom reno being that this weekend is a long weekend we decided to star our bathroom renovations we are planing on going down to sticks and putting all new stuff in from electrical to plumbing to waterproofing so far we have everything torn out except for the old drywall and the electrical when removing the floor it looks like the old owners in the past at some point probably the 70s put in new 1/2"" plywood sub floor over the 1x6 plank sub floor underneath is 1 5/8""x9"" floor joists (im geussing that technically 2x10) in some parts of the floor their are 2 1x3 support braces in an x between 2 joists the 1x6 plank sub floor isnt in the best of shape and probably wont be good for tile unless i stick with schluter ditra i have watched and read quite a bit on doing my own bathroom reno for about 6 months now and know i want to do either ditra or ditra-heat for outside the shower for inside the shower which well make custom i was thinking about doing the schluter kerdi shower system with the kerdi or the kerdi panels in order to do the custom shower pan i was planing on doing a mud style pan i just am unsure about putting that right on top the 1x6 planks as there are larger holes from knots and nails that pounded away a chuck of wood around where the toilet was theres a lot of discoloration like the toilet was leaking slowly and certain other areas have a black discoloration as well not sure if its mold or what it doesnt smell mildewy but it does smell weird now that the sub floor is exposed im just unsure of the 1x6 planks if i should try and cut that all out and replace with new plywood sub floor or do what was done previous and nail in 1/2in ply on top and then start from there here are some photos so far i have specific pictures of around the toilet drain and some dark spots any advice welcome",0

ge led15et8g tube bulbs burning out ballasts i bought some led15et8g tube lights to put in the set of 2 metalux fluorescent fixtures i had in my garage (4 lamp per fixture) these lights are supposed to be able to retrofit into an existing fixture with a ballast no bypass needed after installing them the next morning they both died checked the switch and the ends they were wired to both getting 120v (ballast is rated from 120 to 277) just to check i bypassed the ballast on one and they turn on but are very dim im guessing this is why the ballast is required for them (ive seen other led tubes can have the ballast bypassed) i found another fixture i had a shop one that hangs off chains installed 2 of the bulbs and they came on less than 10 minutes later the ballast burned out on this one too what kind of fixtures should i be using on these lights can anyone link me to some i can order online or get at a hardware store i didnt expect these to be such a pain,0
adjustable sit/stand desk for under $200 [full project album i had a need to build myself a new desk and decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and make an adjustable sit/stand desk while i was at it i looked at a lot of off-the-shelf solutions on the market but since i dont relish a squeaky crank that takes 30+ seconds to raise/lower or an electrical motor which can fail (i know nothing about electrical) i opted to create one based on counterweights theres very little i could find in the way of documentation / inspiration out there but [this instructable post](https://wwwinstructablescom/id/convertible-standingsitting-desk-for-200/) was an amazing starting point based on that i spent some time making modifications then worked nights/weekends to build my own model its by no means perfect but it works really well for my needs and considering its half the cost of a varidesk or similar model it might help someone else here brainstorm an even better way to build their own edit: misspellings,0

question about mwbc wiring from panel house built in 1994 i am finishing the basement and am roughing in the wiring i hired a licensed electrician to install a subpanel as my main panel is full i was planning on using the existing basement circuit from the main panel for one of the circuits but am confused because the wire is 14/3 from the panel based on my research it appears that this was going to be wired as a multi wire branch circuit set up ie shared neutrals for 2 circuits using a single 14/3 wire the issue i am having is after looking at the main panel i am not seeing any red wires anywhere near the applicable breaker and as i understand it to do an mwbc to code it has to be wired out of a double pole breaker what am i missing here for reference the subpanel is only for 4 simple circuits 1 20 amp bathroom circuit 2 bedroom circuits with one light and 6 receptacles each and one circuit for 4 led hall lights and 9 receptacles nothing complicated,0
help request: closet door finish after removing frame i need to graciously ask for some help on a mini construction project that i literally evolved from a simple door installation heres the down and dirty of what i need help on im installing a rolling door across a closet in my house ive built the door & installed the hardware needed when placing the door on the top rail that the door frame interfered with the rolling door so i needed to remove the door frame what i removed is just the outside frame which leaves a gap between the rest of the frame that runs along the inside of the closet opening and the wall my question is about finishing it would one normally just remove the center piece and the back frame piece ie take off the entire frame leaving just the bare wall and drywall and finish it from there if so how do i do that do i just use a putty to fill in the gaps or should i put a layer of drywall on top of the wood framing any help would be appreciated my end goal is to just get it to a finished state images: thanks,0

"replacing diagonal deck boards under a screen porch i have a deck where 1/2 the deck is under a screen porch and 1/2 is exposed to the elements unfortunately the time has come to replace the deck boards however only the outside part of the deck needs to be replaced the inside looks nearly new the challenge is that the boards are diagonal so in many cases the deck board is underneath the screen porch and then extends to the open deck im hoping to get some advice on how to go about this i think my options are: 1 cut the deck boards off at the edge of the screen porch and start the new boards there my only concern is how i will make this cut so close the screened in area id like the cut to be directly next to the screen porch so i can cover it with a piece of trim and hide an unsightly seam i thought about trying a reciprocating saw this would only have a seam across the door entry way but making the cut concerns me 2 try and remove each board in its entirety by sliding it out and then sliding the new one in they are stapled down underneath the screen porch ""walls"" so this will not be an easy task and will also waste many deck boards that are in good condition 3 try and strip/sand the outside boards so they can be refinished and leave in place does anyone have any advice or how youve tackled this in the past pictures of what im dealing with are attached https://ireddit/dlyp7xc3fvj31jpg https://ireddit/00pmsmd3fvj31jpg https://ireddit/qrepejd3fvj31jpg",0

looking for advice on sealing a camera wire running into a vehicle hey so im going to be installing a whole bunch of [mdvrs](https://wwwamazoncom/gp/product/b078x5bh2p/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00ie=utf8&psc=1) into a fleet of busses the cameras use a standard 4-pin aviation connector (i believe its about 20mm) i obviously want to make sure that the hole going into the bus is sealed so im trying to explore my options as far as seals and grommets go right now i believe my options are: 1 get a 20mm generic grommet and cut a hole large enough for just the cable and hope that i can stretch it around the connector 2 somehow find a 20mm grommet with the center hole the right size for the cable and then cut it so that i can fit in the connector 3 im not super keen on this but cut off the connector run the wire through the grommet and then splice the connector back on ~~i believe i could probably get away with doing this separately before inserting the cable into the hole of the bus but it might make it tough to get the grommet in~~ edit: not sure how this would work actually because i dont have any room to work with inside of the panel to actually splice things together the hole would just end up being the size of the connector still which wouldnt solve the issue are there any other better options that im missing what would you recommend i do plan to silicone around the grommet as well just to seal it better but i would prefer not to silicone in a 20mm hole ha,0

putting room back together after water damage- wall question a water main break in my second home occurred last year sadly it wasnt discovered for 2 weeks when it was nearly 1 of water was throughout the lower level of the house (affecting carpet studs drywall etc) i had a remediation company come start the process of removing mold/mildew/moisture i also had an air hygienist inspect for residual spores the house passed muster fast forward many months and now i have a new tile floor in every room new plumbing new electrical and the studs have been replaced if they couldnt be cleaned the house is dry and only a faint smell of mildew exists i still need the hvac cleaned and upstairs carpeting steamed the drywall was cut 25 from the floor since there was evidence of moisture in the walls/floor prior to the flood id like to ensure no moisture gets to affect the walls again should i replace with mold/mildew resistant drywall or could i just place thin insulation and then moisture proof wainscoting im pretty confident that no further leaks will occur any other tips on mildew prevention in regards to walls trim and floors thank you for lending your experience and expertise,0

"closed cell spray foam trimming ive decided to remodel my home built in the 50s ive gutted rewired upgraded service raised ceiling height replaced windows and more im dealing with 35"" stud bays and was debating whether to fur out studs to fit something like an r19 or go with foam i decided to go the closed cell foam route and have my kits i wish i had done a bit more research on the trimming side of it because im running into the problem of how best to trim it ive seen everything from people modifying sawzalls for 36"" blades to the fancy custom planers with the 20+ wire wheels that cost an arm and a leg so my question is what works well i havent sprayed yet but need to do so soon as i have drywall slated for 3 weeks from now i have a full machine shop if modifying something is the best route but i would rather not spend 700 on one of the modified sawzalls if there is a cheaper way to still do it effectively since i wont have a use for it in the future also any advice that might help me out in the spraying would be appreciated",0

"there is a floor above my floor is this common hey everyone i am a first time homebuyer and admittedly i took on my first house which was most likely above my abilities but here i am trying to do and learn as much as i can &#x200b; 2 weekends ago i decided to tear up the old disgusting carpet the previous homeowner had and i was going to lay down some 12mm laminate plank i got 3 rows of the flooring installed before it because clear that it wasnt going to be possible on the warped flooring due to a lot of sag i thought it over for a couple weeks and then decided that i would take a trip into the crawlspace (previously unvisited due to not knowing where the entrance was) and take a look at the joist/subflooring state i figured i could jack it up install some support and it wouldnt be all that bad &#x200b; enter today i cut a small hole in my sons closet so that i could hopefully create a hatch and then properly fix it after after cutting the piece of plywood though i was met with another layer of flooring i then realized that there were no actual joists that i could see immediately but 2x4 framing after putting the pieces together i realized that the front entrance of my house has a weird 5"" or so step in a doorway that seems a few inches short it hit me that for some reason im assuming the condition of the true subfloor that at some point an owner installed a second floor system above the original &#x200b; is this common a lot of things in this house were obviously hacked together &#x200b; &#x200b; edit: \[pictures in link at bottom\] i really did not expect this much of a response holy crap but anyways: &#x200b; so i thought i would come back and update this i spent a lot of time thinking about this and then went to lowes the original picture is taken where i planned to put a hatch and is located in the bedroom closet on the (insert obvious joke here) floor but the flooring i am actually concerned with currently is in my dining room after i found this and read through a bunch of advice i decided that i would try to cut a bit out of the dining room subfloor and weigh the idea of just doing the second layer subfloor making it look good flooring it and pretending that it never was an issue until i got a chance to actually look under the house &#x200b; well this was not the case &#x200b; i made a small hole in the living room floor only to find the actual crawlspace i then realized that there was actually a 2x6 sitting on top of what i assume was the original joists raising my floor roughly 55 inches explaining the height difference between the bathroom and the front entrance ive decided to rip up all the subfloor and remove the 2x6s that raise my floor which should make sense of the entrance and bathroom and then tie new joists into the existing old ones for strength while also providing a new straight surface as well as adding additional supports (the current space between the joists 18"" apart was a 2x8 perpendicular at every 30""s im going to put them at probably every 15""s knowing that its likely overkill but safer than sorry) after all this im going to resheet it with plywood and then lay my laminate (vapor barrier included) &#x200b; more pictures in this link : dining room more floor in under my floor &#x200b; [floorception - a floor withing a floor](https://ireddit/z2zmp8an1tj31jpg)",0

changing outlet that has 3 live wires 3 neutrals and 1 ground have a few questions hi images: i was going to change out this outlet it was previously all shoved together in a back-wire type outlet (the kind you just stab in) was going to replace with a new side-wire outlet but wasnt expecting 6 total wires for now ive just pig-tailed the 3 live wires together & the 3 neutral wires together so that the next several outlets down work (crucially the refrigerators outlet doesnt work unless these are all connected) couple questions: * so id just pigtail in 2 more wires - 1 white wire to the 3 neutral wires and 1 black wire to the 3 live wires then connect those to single posts in the new outlet * is this notexcessively crowded in that electrical box is that ok * anything else im missing that means im going to burn down my house thanks **edit: pigtailed - outlet works as do the outlets down the line from this one thanks** ended up going to home depot to get red wire connections [link](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/commercial-electric-winged-wire-connectors-red-30-pack-778324/302686289) and also some wire as i didn thave any [link](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/southwire-15-ft-14-2-solid-romex-simpull-cu-nm-b-w-g-wire-28827426/202210510) that wire you can split the sheath and inside are a black wire a white wire and a bare copper one then just connect everything (after twistng the wires into the connector i used pliers to twist it tighter) then shove everything back in fail try again and done for now at least,0

ridge vents or solar powered attic fans i live in mississippi very hot and very humid i have a bit of mold in one area of the attic and have determined that i dont have enough air moving i am also getting condensation on some of my interior ceilings on particularly hot and humid days insulation is fine i have openings on the south side of the roof to allow for ventilation but no fans etc a friend of mine is suggesting cutting a ridge vent (the house was built in the 1960s and does not have a ridge vent installed) another suggests installing attic gable fans at the openings on the south side of the roof i have ordered the attic fans but i have yet to receive and install them the ones i ordered are 40 watt each and one of them is listed to adequately ventilate 2250 square feet (my house is about 1800 square feet) so which would you do attic ridge vents or solar powered fans or both,0

my sons house is a moldy disaster ill try to make this short son bought a 1950s ranch home in the country about 6 years ago 2 years ago they started smelling mold and after it got worse discovered it was coming from the end of the house bedroom walls so they replaced the roof took up the wet insulation in the attic used something to kill mold in the rafters new insulation also took out some of the drywall in the bedroom around a window and i cant remember what was done there but son supposedly fixed repaired/repainted last winter this spring/summer the smell returned last week he pulled the siding off the end of the house and revealed it was siding over cedar (why this was done in the past i have no idea) son discovered the two windows on that side of the house hadnt been installed properly they were leaking down into the walls i helped him paint zinsser mold killing primer over the 2x4s and everything we could reach with a paintbrush (i think i was painting the backside of the 2 bedrooms drywall) i believe his plan is to replace the insulation fix the windows reapply the siding and hope for the best im his mom and dont know more details just know what i smelled yesterday and it is awful his wife and children have been sick every month since they moved into the house has he done enough to eliminate this hes worked so hard and im so worried for them if the leaks are all stopped will the mold continue now that it has had such a firm hold on the house,0

fridge water supply/icemaker line: braided ss vs pex hello we live in an apartment but own our own fridge i want to add a water supply/icemaker line ive been doing a lot of reading and it seems that it isnt unusual to have to run it under/through cabinets and across a cooking range what i see much less of is consensus between what to use for supply line we wont use copper or the cheap plastic but ive seen good things about both pex and braided stainless steel lines i just wondered what you think of each which you prefer and why is one less likely to have issues than the other that would be helpful to know in an apartment setting i will install a proper splitter valve (no saddle) and shutoff its a fairly long run ive read that theres no length limit issues w/ this type of line ill be a fairly long run - probably 25ft (including the extra to pull out the fridge) any thoughts you could share would be brilliant thanks so much in advance (hopefully this doesnt get flagged bc its not getting started or any of the other things in the prohibited list for the forum),0

effective plywood shutter installation i am not sure if this is the right place or not for this but i threw together a guide for those that will be in a panic about putting up hurricane shutters this weekend in florida a lot of times people just panic and get whatever plywood they can and get wood screws and go crazy attaching boards to their windows this doesnt offer as much protection as one would think so i made a little guide in the hopes that it will be seen and improve the protection received by those who do not have professionally installed steel/aluminum shutters if there is a better place for this please let me know,0
10yr cedar fence w/o stain tried using cleaner and its a nightmare so is it safe to powerwash instead bought my home and didnt realize the fence was not stained ten years later and im trying to restore it from the weathered look it has acquired home depot staff told me to use behr cleaner on it because they said powerwashing is thought to push water too deep into the wood but pretty much hate my life with this cleaner because im scrubbing until my arm about falls off and at this pace it will take about 20-30 hours of total scrubbing to clean a short fence that spans only half a 50x150 house lot in the city (aka not much fence) there has to be a better way did hd get it wrong is it safe to powerwash and then stain/seal a few days after grateful for any advice on this,0

backyard getting a facelift need advice good evening reddit wife and i are planning to fix up the back yard (16 x 13) in the immediate future currently getting quotes to replace the fence (20 long x 13 wide (including gate) and if it costs too much ill be doing it instead once thats done ill be regrading the yard installing some type of drainage system and putting in new pavers ive done most of this work before at my parents house friends houses etc the one thing i havent done is drainage which is why ive come asking for help today :) the back door and the gate are in opposite corners of the yard the gutter downspout comes down right next to the back door and just dumps the water there while i havent had any flooding issues i just dont like it i originally wanted to just extend the gutter out of the yard but thats going to be a long pip in the middle of the yard and again i dont like it after spending the day at working looking at drain stuff i think i have the basics down just dont know how to finish it im thinking i could put a grate under the downspout to collect the water then install a french drain along the side of the yard terminating into a dry well at the edge of my yard (havent decided whether to do it just inside my fence or just outside) what i dont know is how deep does a french drain need to be buried ive read that it should be roughly 12 inches deep- is that 12 at the bottom or top of the pipe also if you look at the picture from the back gate you may notice orange markings- thats the cable line they never buried it so i will (probably put it in a pvc pipe) next if i have the french drain terminate at a dry well do i need to have an outlet from the well or does it just end there [from the [from the back thanks in advance for any advice you can give me,0

looking for guidance on refinishing wood trim i recently bought a house and the trim and all the cabinets were a very very dark stained wood i want white trim/ cabinets i redid all the cabinets in a very time consuming paint wasting way to say the least i sanded the doors but i didnt want to coat the inside of my house with sawdust (i really should have posted here a long time ago) so i used jasco sander deglosser and painted about 4-5 coats inside that took what seemed like forever so for the trim i wanted to do something different without sanding still as im not comfortable removing the trim i got some citristrip and it worked for a small patch but it took letting it sit for over a whole day to get it there im just looking for some advice on a good stripper that wont take a terribly long time to work thank you in advance,0

tight staircase - need some suggestions my basement stairs need a proper banister and balusters for safety and to meet building code (ontario) im having a hard time visualizing how these stairs will look when finished and google hasnt turned up good finished examples of people having done similar heres pictures of my stairs and pics from a neighbor with a similar layout (with banister added no balusters) my problem is that the stringer for the stairs is in line with the drywall on top i want a handrail that goes the full length of the stairs and balusters between the baluster tops wall and handrail im not sure how to make it fit newel post i can do easy handrail is harder **sweep handrail** \- i cannot find a picture of someone sweeping a handrail around a ceiling transition like that only a vertical wall transition the problem is that the handrail needs to sweep in about 4 steps before the side is closed off so id need to have 4 steps with balusters in the middle im wondering why i cant find a pic anywhere of anyone who has done this though everyone who puts a regular banisters over the stringer in these situations seems to end it at the ceiling and leave a big gap [example](http://macmillanandsoninccom/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/1522236158-striped-stair-carpet1-960x1280jpg) **pigs ear handrail -** [example](https://wwwloveskirtingcouk/images/solid-walnut-pigs-ear-handrail-3-6-metre-p465-12747_imagejpg) i could put a pigs ear handrail directly over top the stringer i would cut a section a drywall out to recess the rail so that the outside of the stringer and the outside of the rail are aligned then i could use simple round tube spindles to baluster drilling proper holes into the bottom of the pigs ear might be challenging not sure how this will look in the end anyone have any other suggestions or ideas or other finished examples,0

"carpeting question: thickness how much space to leave so everything is level im building a theater riser and the plan is to have a 4"" band of wood around the top perimeter and then carpet inside the perimeter (like the picture below) question is how much space if any should i leave between the plywood floor and the hardwood perimeter so that the carpet can be installed properly is there a minimum/maximum height difference between the plywood floor and the hardwood perimeter that i should pay attention to (i assume the answer to that last one simply depends on the thickness of the carpet and pad but figured id ask) thanks &#x200b; [this is sort of the look i am going for on the riser so my question i guess is whether the carpet will just come up to the edge and stop and thats it or do i need to leave some kind of gap for it to tuck in to](https://ireddit/ggt34l8xfej31jpg)",0

basement master bathroom redo question hi all my husband and i bought a split level (built in 1979) a few years back weve been slowly remodeling the entire thing and its become a chore because of the previous owners cutting corners with everything anyways recently found some water damage in the basement bathroom (master) we decided to just gut the entire thing and make a nice updated bathroom it right now only has 1 bowl sink vanity corner shower toilet i said we should just call a plumber and make it a 2 bowl vanity since its our master bathroom and that would appeal to home buyers when we go to sell my husband is now suggesting we move the toilet and keep a one bowl vanity a but have an enlarged shower my question is in everyones opinion is it worth more for us to have a double vanity or an enlarged shower which will be better for resell thanks,0

ac furnace leak (also posted in r/homeowners hoping to figure this out before having an hvac co come out) hi all the other day i came home to a musty smelling basement (which was odd- weve never gotten water) found that my utility closet had quite a bit of water on the floor though i turned off the ac and was hoping it was just an issue with the condensate pump or line cleaned those all out thought they were fine i just turned the ac back on today to see if it fixed the issue because i couldnt see where the water was coming from originally needless to say its still leaking theres a pvc line going to the condensate pump thats fine and dry i know nothing about ac but there is another hole right to the left of that pipe that is leaking down into a hole in the furnace then onto the floor it actually looks like it was only covered in duct tape and the tape broke free seems very odd can i just cap that line off should i run something from that into the condensate pump should i call a pro total noob here weve lived here just over a year and of course didnt renew our home warranty which ended last month pics:,0

fixing a fluorescent lamp fixture hello i am really not experienced in electrical work at all obviously i have tried changing the 4 lamps within it and when that did not work i am thinking it is the ballast however the ballast does not look damaged or worn at all it almost looks brand new so i am not too sure if this is the cause have tried the breakers etc and no luck whatsoever the fixture was working perfectly up until a few weeks ago when it just would not turn on i thought that it would be strange to have all 4 bulbs go out and obviously the bulbs were not the case any pointers here thanks,0

connecting wires to a plug i recently ordered a fancy lamp from china the base of the lamp where the bulb screws in has wires coming out that end in frayed edges with the innards of the wire being exposed this is supposed to connect to a separate wire set that has a plug that can be plugged in however im not sure how im supposed to go about connecting the wires-- no instructions were included here is a picture: at the bottom of the picture are the two wires coming from the base of the lamp at the top of the picture is the edge of the wire that has a plug on it these two parts are supposed to connect but im not sure how to do it myself or if i need professional assistance many thanks for your help **edit** here are some additional pictures showing where the wires connect to the base of the lamp as well as a small plastic piece that may be a wire nut as someone in the comments asked about there were several plastic pieces like this included about 5 or 6,0

fastening sill plate to concrete slab im going to be installing a couple of new walls in my basement for a new bathroom what type of fasteners do you guys recommend for fastening the sill plate to the concrete slab the walls will be non-load bearing so the fasteners are just there to keep the bottom of the wall in place right now the options that i know of are: 1 wedge anchors i think these are going to be overkill and more expensive than necessary for a non-structural application 2 [tapcon concrete screws](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/tapcon-1-4-in-x-3-1-4-in-hex-washer-head-concrete-anchors-75-pack-24301/202516409) 3 [red head hammer-set anchors](https://wwwhomedepotcom/p/red-head-1-4-in-x-3-in-hammer-set-nail-drive-concrete-anchors-25-pack-35207/203064111) i have no problem using a hammer drill for whichever anchors i choose ive also used tapcons before for other applications and didnt have any issues with them thanks in advance edit: i guess i should have added that im not interested in renting a powder actuated gun when i already have the tools to install the other options i only have about 20 linear feet of wall to do so the minimal time savings isnt going to be worth the cost of the rental,0

"need some advice/input for cement basement steps hi there was hoping someone with more experience than i could give me a bit of advice about my outside basement entrance top step i had a bunch of old sidewalk behind my house leading to these and the concrete was all broken and bucking and needed to be replaced when i started working on it i realized that there was an issue with the steps that the previous owner had kind of quick and dirty ""fixed"" its pulled out about an inch or so from the rest of the basement steps unbeknownst to me the previous owner had filled it with sand and then some (like 1/4-1/2"") cement on top on the outside of the top step there is roughly 6-6 1/2"" of concrete sitting directly on the soil i do not think i have a pic of it but the cement goes down at an angle matching the steps and the rest of the stairs seem fine this top step is the only one that has pulled away and broken over the years i am assuming i should dig down here when i re-pour this step i am just not sure how far i live in the philadelphia pa area we have a clay-ish soil here and i know that the frost line depth for fence posts etc is 18"" and foundations is like 36"" i just dont know how deep to dig to stabilize this like do i need 18"" of solid concrete under here or a foundation of stone and rubble and then a few extra inches of concrete or also is there a way to secure it to the rest of the steps should i try and drill through the one under it and add rebar or something i talked to a concrete guy and kinda got a ""well just repour the step and ignore it if you arent gonna stay there forever"" but i think thats not super cool requisite pics: thanks in advance for any thoughts",0

"need ideas and/or advice for a deck gate we have a second-floor condo that has a staircase leading to our back deck (and the one for the condo above us) and need to put in some form of gate were not allowed to alter the railing though so it limits our options the previous owner used a piece of lattice attached on one side with zip ties as hinges and then ""latched"" with a bungee cord the lattice ended up breaking when left open on a windy day which wasnt a terrible tragedy because it was cheap and getting very saggy anyway since then weve been using a baby gate connected on either side with bungee cords this was never intended to be a permanent solution though because its not secure annoying to put back in place (we exit via our back door 99% of the time) and now unsafe for our toddler since she can easily unlock the screen door to get outside and cant resist either rattling the gate or playing with the bungee cords and id like to replace it before she manages to knock it loose and fall down the stairs right now it feels like our best option is to just get a new piece of lattice and go back to the old way (except with a fastening solution other than a bungee cord since the kid is too smart for her own good and will defeat those soon) but im open to other ideas thanks tl;dr: i need a deck gate without any drilling or other rail-altering installation required",0

flooring advice request: removing wood floor glued to original hardwoods hey all as the title states i currently have a layer of wood veneer flooring that is glued to what i believe are the original hardwoods home built in 1947 from the crawlspace i can see what i believe is roofing paper between the original hardwoods and a wood plank subfloor im about halfway through pulling up the top layer but there is a lot of scraping to be done and im unsure of the best course forward leaving me with a few questions 1) should i pull up the original hardwoods as well the floor is sagging a bit and im wondering if i should pull everything up and put osb over the existing subfloor then lay down new hardwoods although the additional time and cost of this is a little concerning 2) would it be a mistake to just get enough of the glue up and then re-glue down a new floor over the top of the original hardwoods again 3) ive gouged the original hardwoods in a few places if there is a possibility sand them back to workable shape what would be a good way to address the more severe spots thanks in advance,0
"so my sink just gave out sink plughole help my sink plughole just gave out judging by the insides its quite old im hoping things can just be slotted back into place and hold with a bit of silicone but im struggling to figure out how this is meant to go the top bit has notches cut out which look like they should fit into notches on the piece which comes up through the plughole but there is no ""opposite"" piece to slot into the pipe which comes from below and up through the hole drops without any support and since it doesnt screw into the bit above im struggling to see how this should work my fix was going to be just place everything back in position with a bunch of silicone and hope for the best but there was no silicone when it fell apart so there mustve been some mechanics in place to hold it all together is silicone an option or just buy a new plughole and pipe connector and screw that in i appreciate any help because as you can see i dont have a clue",0

looking to make my first homemade lava lamp any help is appreciated so i like lava lamps quite a bit the idea of making my own was always a thought but i never quite had the drive nor the motivation to build one up until this morning so ive done some moderate research on the topic already (free time and dead spots at work allow it) most results gave me mineral oil glitter lamps which is not what im seeking heres some basic info that i can provide for peer review/cross examination i have a jack daniels bottle (750ml) and i think itd be the perfect container for a lava lamp i also hate just throwing away glass bottles that have nice etchings on them the bottle itself was what sparked the interest i can make a basic light stand for it no problem with basic pvc piping or a can/fixture from an electrical retailer or any crafts store (at least in chicago) and would most likely use a 40w bulb given the size and density of the glass bottle i know the wax mixture is typically paraffin (ive also heard its a mix of paraffin and beeswax) which can ve acquired at most places wal-mart comes to mind but as for the rest of the set up im rather lost ive heard mixed things on the liquid mixture i know it isnt straight water ive seen one instructional video that lists a mixture of 71 percent rubbing alcohol and 91 percent rubbing alcohol but the consistency of the globules in that video were runny and small not like the large globules of wax youd see in a traditional commercial lamp in tandem with that im not sure how id color the wax ive also seen that using oil pastels in the wax mixture will give it a desired color any help or an instructional how-to from other lava lamp diyers would be amazing this would totally become a hobby of mine once i get the ropes down i just need to get the ball rolling on this first one thanks in advance,0

updating two honey-colored oak tables: can i use gel stain to avoid stripping/sanding i have a square table and a side table that are amish-made oak with the dreaded honey-colored stain on them the surfaces are all blessedly flat so im thinking that it would not be too hard to refinish them with a darker stain (walnut to espresso) before i go out and buy stripper and an orbital sander i am wondering if anyone has experience using gel stain i have heard you can apply it over existing stain if you are going for a darker color if this is the case i might even update the four chairs i have that match this set-- they are far more detailed and there would be no way id sand them down i was going to just look to buy new chairs to match the new stain but if i can easily update the existing ones id be all for it,0

"60"" flatscreen mounted with self screwing drywall anchors should i be worried so i just bought a 60"" flatscreen that weighs about 50lbs its mounted on the wall with 8 toggler brand plastic self screwing drywall anchors rated up to about 70lbs each i know using lag bolts into studs is obviously the preferred way of mounting but that wasnt an option because the location of the mounting bracket its currently holding but with the top of the bracket very slightly pulled away from the wall its been a good 6 hours since mounting the tv and that gap hasnt increased provided that gap doesnt worsen should i be fine leaving it mounted or is it safe to assume those anchors will fail indefinitely",0

rental: stacking things on gas oven hello ive recently moved into a 50s-era rental house that has limited kitchen space theres a little gas oven and a hob next to it it would be great to use the space on top of the oven for food prep or for my kettle/toaster but naturally it gets quite hot i was considering grabbing some fire-resistant board to pop on top so i can use it as another surface but im not sure if its safe or a great recipe for fire when ive been researching most of the guidance is for electric ovens or gas ovens that have a hob on top rather than the oven on its own some things ive read have discouraged it but usually due to ventilation concerns which is not a concern in this case because theres no ventilation on top tl;dr is putting a fire-resistant board on top of a gas oven and then leaving your electric kettle or toaster on top a recipe for fire thank you very much,0

"tile project - discovered a triple layer of very thin backer-board under tile i just tore up the tile in my second floor bathroom and i only have experience doing tile work on my first floor and directly on the slab hopefully the link i attached is functional and you can visualize what i have going on with my second floor it appears that the previous owner secured some type of mulit-layer backer-board right over the existing linoleum flooring and then tiled over that im confused because there are three very thin layers of backer-board and when i pulled the tile i cleanly removed the top thin layer of backer-board im thinking that maybe i got lucky and can just tile over what is left on the floor (the 2 thin layers of backer-board) or im screwed and have to pull everything up and start from scratch ive never seen or used this very thin (each layer is \~3/32"") backer board so its throwing me off is it possible that the previous installer intentionally used this triple layer so that the next install would be quick and easy has anyone ever used or seen this technique before any help would be appreciated thanks edit: after some research i have learned that the ""multi-layer"" underlayment that i am seeing is a result of the 1/4 hardibacker ""delaminating"" apparently older versions of hardi are laminated plan is to demo everything down to the subfloor and put down new 1/4"" hardi [https:\/\/drivegooglecom\/drive\/folders\/1gqmkhthimhqxsopmtthhadgktuzkuvc\_usp=sharing](https://ireddit/893adaoqavi31jpg)",0

rehabbed master bath that was in dire need of a facelift let me preface by saying i have very little experience with any kind of rehab but i have been reading this sub for several months so between this and many dozens of hours of youtube how-to videos my confidence level was just enough to begin demoing something i decided my drab master bath would be my first project i mean how hard could it be right i apologize for the sporadic photos as it wasnt my original intention to document the remodel but at some point i figured it would be good to get opinions from this knowledgeable community i didnt do anything that might be considered overly difficult i did find some bonus space behind the prefab shower so i tiled it in and made a larger shower with a bench the only thing i didnt do myself was a bit of plumbing- had to have the shower valve changed out (wasnt aware of this until after shower was tiled so had to cut access hole from back side) and also had the plumber hook up the sink which required a fair amount of cutting to the back of the vanity total cost was in the $3k-$3500 range i suspect this is considerably cheaper than a contractor would have charged though i didnt get any quotes entire project took 9 or 10 weeks of part-time work but i was in no rush biggest surprise was cost and meticulousness of waterproofing the shower alcove hope you all dont slay me too badly bathroom renovation,0
is it possible to operate a bank of led ceiling lights that is controlled from 3 locations with a dimmer switch we recently had our kitchen remodeled (not diy) and part of that process was installing a bank of 7 led ceiling lights they are slimline canless led lights that are 15w / 120v / 60hz and claim to be dimmable in the product listing and in all the included documentation (not including a link to the exact product because i think that may be against the rules) all the lights are controlled as a group and cannot be turned on or off individually there are 3 different switches that can turn these lights on and off and they are wired correctly where each switch will turn the lights to the opposite state of what they currently are the electrician was originally going to install a dimmer switch but didnt for some reason i wasnt around when this happened so wasnt able to ask him why and i have no direct way to contact him as he was a subcontractor are the lights actually dimmable with this setup i have a limited understanding of all this stuff but ive swapped out a few light switches and wall plugs when necessary i feel comfortable enough doing that but i just have no idea what i need to actually accomplish this i only need to be able to dim the lights from one of the switches even though the lights can be controlled from 3 different switches we rarely use 2 of them im not looking for an exact product recommendation but i just need to know what terms and specifications i should look for when selecting a dimmer switch to accomplish my goal from the research ive done im guessing i just need a single 3-way switch that is capable of handling at least 105w (i would also like to get a smart switch if possible assuming there is one available that fits my needs),0

unfing old plumbing vent so im doing a bathroom renovation in a property i recently bought im taking the bathroom down to studs and just ran into my first major issue the stack is cast iron and at some point was monkeyed with they put pvc in for the bathroom drains however above where the bathroom drains to the stack the old ci was left in place just hanging in the wall (and secured to non structural studs) that same ci also goes up and out as the vent so theres a bunch of ci stack left in the wall (open on both ends) and not secured very well im thinking im going to want to cut that out and replace it with pvc and get a proper roof vent again what im not sure about is how to secure it when im cutting it out id say its approximately 15 feet (from the bathroom floor out through the attic) the stud that its currently strapped to is non structural (its toenailed into the floorboards) so i dont trust that to continue to hold that stack up im looking to add more strapping for now for additional support and peace of mind is strapping and cutting smaller sections going to be the way to go i was also thinking of adding some boards under the current opening (across the floor opening) for additional support i definitely appreciate any insight or feedback thanks edit: pictures-[imgur](https://iimgurcom/k92vsohjpg) more,0

why insulate between rafters hi all i need some advise on whether it is better to insulate between and under rafters or only under rafters i had intended to insulate with 3cm kingspan board between rafters maintaining a 4cm airgap above & 10cm of insulating kingspan board beneath the rafters 30 years ago many of the original rafters were reinforced or replaced but there is signs of new rot on the old rafters i am treating all the woodwork with multiple coats of 5 star wood treatment im thinking it would be easier to combine both boards underneath so 13cm of insulation with fewer gaps/joins and that maximising the air gap between the rafters and the felt would be better any advise appreciated,0

led strip lighting questions hello im kind of an amateur at this please go easy on me i wonder if anyone here will be able to clear some things up and put me on the right track with a project of mine if theres a more appropriate place to post this please do tell i have a shelving unit that i intend to attach an addressable rgb led strip controlled by a arduino uno there are 5 shelves each 15m wide that would be 75m in total i would have to get a 5m (i understand the strips dont come longer than that) and a 3m and splice them together in series now im trying to find out if this would be a bad idea i understand due to voltage drop the leds towards the end could become faded another option ive considered is to forgo the bottom shelf and wire two 3 meter strips in parallel (2 shelfs per strip) as much as id like to i imagine it would be much more convoluted to wire all 5 shelves up in this way now my second problem is all the different options for powering it there are 5v or 12v varieties i wonder why i would choose one over the other i know i can power the arduino off either but apparently it can get quite hot running on 12v the strip im looking at is rated at 9w per meter so if ive got this right for 6 meters id need either a 15a or 6a transformer for a 5v or 12v transformer respectively (taking in to account the 20% rule and rounding to the next available type) alternatively if i did all 75m 20a or 8a the rest of the wiring should be fairly straight forward i know the data line will be in series regardless and the programming is no problem thanks for reading i appreciate any and all advice from people,0

advice on prep to insulate part of a very old airy garage so we have a large old detached garage from the 40-50s or so that we use as a shop (house is 18) its basically the scrap versions of 2x4s with vertical planks on the outside (you can see through the gaps) in one corner im building out a small office with ac about 10 x 8 which will need good insulation on all sides (weather here is tropical texas) for insulating the outside walls i need to improve them to avoid just growing a mold science project once the walls are more sealed as it is rain with some wind behind it will seep in but no issue right now as air flows freely through the whole space and the slab is elevated and in good shape i was thinking 1 pull the planks off in that area (this is pretty easy) 2 sheath it in thin-ish plywood past the office bays 3 sheath it with a wrap/tyvek 4 put the old planks back on 5 insulate the bays inside and proceed as normal i know there will be some unevenness at the transition where the plywood is added but its not a big deal given the rustic nature of the whole structure also were planning to demo the whole thing and build a new garage + apt in the next ~5 years so also not looking to rework the whole thing thanks the exterior interface is not where my experience lies,0

[need advice] thoughts on how to remove the rest of this elastomeric paint from a flat roof &#x200b; i applied this elastomeric paint (several coats) to a flat roof about 6 years ago water ended up ponding on it and it ended up peeling up to what it looks like now i should have leveled it or used a different coating underneath is a rubberized roof i believe &#x200b; removing this by hand and scraper will probably take forever but is probably the safest way without damaging the rubber i was thinking about renting or buying a pressure washer and using a minimal setting to remove it all my last resort is manually with a scraper and maybe a stiff bristle broom after i remove it i plan on using bitumen or one of the silver paints that can withstand some ponding thoughts on removal edit: barely step on it need to gently shovel in the winter though when we get abnormal amounts of snow sometimes we would like to sit out there once and a while though,0

is this bathroom sink shut-off valve leaking or is the leak coming from the pipe feeding into the valve hi i dont have much experience plumbing except chaning out a p-trap and replacing a toilet flange i got back home after being out of town for 3 weeks and noticed water damage im pretty sure the plumbing fixtures are the same year as the house (1954) id replace the shut off valve but im hesitant to do so in case the pipe isnt threaded or if the leak itself is from the pipe behind the wall (in which case id call a plumber) any advice does this look as though replacing the shut off valve will address the leak thanks in advance https://iimgurcom/ehmfywyjpg https://iimgurcom/jekvohmjpg https://iimgurcom/i0f9gunjpg update: so i pulled off the flange and took apart the plaster to get at the threaded nipple coming out of the wall i replaced the shit off valve and installed it with a healthy amount of tape the valve is leak free but you can see tiny droplets forming on the top of the exposed threaded pipe about a 1/4 of an inch before the valves connection i guess i could maybe replace the threaded nipple this is starting to look like a plumbing rabbit hole think i might need to call in a professional thanks for all the replies and help,0

"cement board-to-drywall transition help we are remodelling an old basement bathroom and im currently working on tiling the corner shower with 3x6 white subway tile after installing new drywall and cement board on the shower walls ive reached a point of issue the drywall is 1/2"" thickness while the cement board is 7/16"" thickness leaving a more than optimal transition difference along their seam ive put a little thinset in the gap but need help determining where to put the tile edging: 1 before the seam on the cement board and just fill the drywall side with mud and paint it this uses the tile edging to ""hide"" the difference in depth 2 after the seam on the drywall here i would have to level off the transition (with thinset and tape) and then tile over the ""leveled"" seam 3 other option the shower is 32"" x 32"" and the cement board extends out to 36"" this was suppose to make tiling easy because the width would be 6 tiles across what do you all think my best course of action would be pictures:",0

series vs parallel (peltier tec) hi i have 2 peltier 12v / 15a (i fried my 5a playing with it so bought a higher amps bunch of these) mounted on a large heatsink and fans to remove excess heat from the heatsink the idea is to make a small incubation chamber from a 70q cooler box (i live in the tropics) i have a 12v 30a power supply at home if i mount them in series do i need a 24v 15a power supply vs 12v 30a in parallel are there any other benefits to mount them in series or parallel what happens if i supply less v but adequate amps to the peltiers (do they work but at a reduced efficiency if so: are there formulas to assess the downgrade in performance) last question: what size should the electric cables be (i assume 30a requires stronger cables than when carrying 15a) thanks much,0

"what is a better option to fill this gap between tub and floor edit: i think i might try the idea u/srmalarkey said and see if i can nail straight down to sub floor [the gap in question](https://ivgyme/tzdmpajpg) this is roughly 5/16"" at its biggest point im sure im going to get a lot of people saying i shouldnt be putting laminate floor in a bathroom but this is the second floor ive done in this house and the first floor not only lasted 11 years but it was much cheaper than this and didnt have a lifetime warranty with a 24-hour water spill protection on it and it held up just fine i only changed it because we wanted a different color and higher quality flooring throughout the house so with that said the first floor i left about a quarter inch gap between the tub and the flooring and i just caulked it with a silicone-based caulk when i put this floor in i knew i wanted to reglaze this ugly tub so i left a quarter inch piece of wood in there as a gap place holder but unfortunately i didnt realize until after i move the wood and i set the toilet and everything else that my gap is bigger than a quarter inch so now im kind of stuck with it so im still going to glaze the tub but what is a good solution to fill this gap other than caulk im thinking maybe even a combination of caulk and something else i cant necessarily put base shoe on the tub because i had nothing to nail too thanks",0

help me diyers how to prevent people from whipping open a sliding glass door the entrance to my grandmothers house is an old sliding glass door \> similar to this door [https://wwwpellabranchcom/webres/image/windows-doors/doors/sliding-patio-doorjpg](https://wwwpellabranchcom/webres/image/windows-doors/doors/sliding-patio-doorjpg) but older it has a bottom only track system and predates edgeguards these are plastic guards that sit on either side of the wheels on the bottom to prevent them from bouncing off the track this has never been a problem for her until recently people have been whipping the door open as fast as they can; this of course leads to the door bumping on something on the track and the wheels fall off the track this results in the door being very hard to move until one lifts the door and sets the wheels back on the track the easy fix to this whole problem i know is to simply install edgeguards on the door except this door is exceptionally old & is 70% stained glass (something like this [http://wwwpixballcom/upload/2018/08/27/stained-glass-for-doors-throughout-designs-kmworldblogcom-stained-glass-doors-designs-l-46669894c296a1c7jpg](http://wwwpixballcom/upload/2018/08/27/stained-glass-for-doors-throughout-designs-kmworldblogcom-stained-glass-doors-designs-l-46669894c296a1c7jpg) ) frankly i am terrified at the prospect of removing the door to install the guards because it literally cannot be replaced & if the glass is damaged cannot be fixed &#x200b; **so diyers i need your smarts madness and macgyver skills** i need someway to prevent these monsters; honestly who the hell whips open an antique sliding door from whipping open the door i assume some kind of door plunger system might work something like a storm door but reversed so instead of slowing the door closing(slamming shut) it would slow the opening the door that said any thoughts or ideas would be greatly appreciated,0

foam cross head and flag pole mounting so the crosshead on my door has gotten so beat that it has to be replaced the wood is just short of dry rot and several of the houses in the row including mine have 45 degree flag poles mounted to the crossheads i bought a foam crosshead that is really close to the one that is there now but i feel putting the flag pole back in the same spot on foam wont hold well id just move the mount elsewhere except the flag would be dangerously close to power lines should the wind blow just right and ive put a lot of effort into maintaining the federal styling so now im nit picky about the details and placement theres room behind the foam to mount a board of some kind which would then be attached to brick so i think thats got to happen for the pole to go back up and my question is should i mount the pole to the foam with the wood back (that is the mount directly on foam but anchored into the wood that is behind the foam) or maybe cut a hole in the foam and double the wood there for the mount,0
"looking for latching ideas i realize this sounds a little different but so far i cant decide on the best option i need some advice my project is my wife and i we need a table in our tiny bedroom room is horribly small ive built a small sideways end table of sorts to attach to the headboard which is solid 1"" thick hardwood for ease of communication its basically a wooden box measuring 9"" tall and 14"" square with a 1"" thick base that would sit against the headboard and be used to fasten the box to the headboard we would use it to sit drinks on so it must be just as incredibly stable as the headboard to which its attached the headboard doesnt move during even the most vigorous of activities i realize that some sort of hardware will be present at all times but obviously the box would need to be removable given that hardware must be present and we sleep there the residing hardware would be preferably minimal i imagine it would need to latch on all four sides in order to ensure its stability are there any ideas out there im really hoping you can help us out im not sure if draw/toggle latches would work",0

do i need to affix this to my metal studs hi all i just moved from an apartment with wood studs to a newer place with metal studs i am planning to attach this cb2 acacia helix desk/bookshelf to my wall tonight: [https://wwwcb2com/helix-96-acacia-desk/s660211](https://wwwcb2com/helix-96-acacia-desk/s660211) https://ireddit/wg4qc9pge1i31jpg it has two screws on the top bars and two screw holes under the desk previously i attached one of the desk screws into my wood stud and it didnt move all year however when i tried to install it today i hit a metal stud my partner says theres no need to affix this to a stud however i was taught by my father that doom will follow if you do not attach a heavy shelf to a stud so my question is: does this piece of furniture need to be affixed to the metal stud as you can see from the design of the book shelf the weight is pretty evenly balanced \*down\*and supported by the legs standing on the floor not \*out\* and pulling away from the wall on the other hand it will be carrying probably at least 50 lbs of books and stuff any pointers greatly appreciated i would love if this only needs drywall anchors,0

newbie question about fixing a leaking shower head i use a hand shower head (where it rests in a mount and you can remove it and use it clean specific parts of your body) the shower head has started leaking it isnt the actual shower head itself instead its where the shower arm attaches to the shower arm mount when the shower is on water sprays out from where shower arm and the mount meat my guess is that a seal or washer needs to be replaced whats the best way to check also and here is where i feel like a complete moron when working on fixing this problem do i turn of the water in the shower - using the faucet in the shower that i normally use to turn the shower on and off or do i have to shut off the water flow to the bathroom or something else if i have to shut off the water to the bathroom - where would i find the master valve that controls that heres hoping i dont flood my house,0

what type of flooring is reasonably priced diy feasible and not prone to grow mold being a good son i moved into my parents house they couldnt sell for the right price so they could move and live in their retirement house long story short there was mold in the house mostly the carpets due to moms overzealous carpet shampooing ive ripped the carpets out myself had the rest of the house tested for mold had professionally installed uv filter systems to deal with mold etc as being a good son and fixing this house properly is killing my bank account what are some flooring options i could possibly do myself in the rooms that have the carpet ripped out i see the cork flooring is mold resistant but im guessing any hardwood floor would be i like how polished concrete looks but that looks like an expensive rental and a low success rate of doing it right on my first try or would hiring someone to re-do the floors into polished/glazed concrete be comparable to paying for hardwood floors to be installed,0

garage: leveling the slab and adding a drain my bungalow house (1987 quebec canada) is built on a monolythic slab (no basement) with a 2-car garage attached (24 x 24) the garage is built on a separate slab 75 inches thick there is a large crack parallel to the street in front with smaller cracks going to the corners of the garage the garage has settled in the front corners so it now slopes towards the left and right entrance of the garage i also just had a water softener inside the garage installed and because it needs to evacuate some water every week we just made the pipe run through an old fanhole inside the garage up to one of the agricultural drain outside (no french since there is no basement) so this part is a bit akward the drain would be ideal to park our cars safely during winter and have the water softener pipe installed under the slab i am a bit lost about the process since this is a slab on grade garage and there are cracks in it a contractor came and said he could jack the garage easily with just 1 pile in each corner but i did not speak to him about putting a drain what should i do here are some pictures: thanks a lot,0

need advice on patio door i have a large patio door [96 x80] in my breezeway that has seen too many years i think it is hard to open and both the fixed and the sliding glass door are misted up pretty badly i called the local high end window and door place and they said a repair would cost me 2k but they dont do it so i am not sure he was just making that up to discourage repair he suggested a new door for between 3 and 4k thats just out of my budget it seems to be a bit much i have seen some at hd for 1500 and they say they install for 3-400 not sure of their quality i know i can remove the door and get new rollers for the sliding issues but not sure what to do about the misting i have replaced windows around the house but this seems a bit out of my league any thoughts welcome,0

hanging things on old plaster walls (or drywall) hello--hoping to get some definitive answers to my ongoing wall saga ive been in my rental for about 7 years now and have tried and failed multiple times throughout the years to get things hung on the walls i never put much thought into this and just assumed my walls were made of drywall but i recently came to the realization that i may have plaster walls due to the following: * old nyc apartment built in 1910--based on my own sleuthing of property records i dont think the units were ever converted/resized so i believe the walls are original * past efforts to get screws into walls ended up in a crumbly mess and/or screws just spinning in place; holes usually end up bigger than the screws ive tried regular screws and those plastic anchor ones and unless theres a stud neither holds ive tried sticking in a thumbtack before--the wall is definitely too hard to do that by hand alone * walls are uneven and bumpy/lumpy (though this could also just be layers of layers of paint throughout the decades) and theres a small thin crack in one spot (again could just be cracked paint) * anyone remember making those rain sticks in grade school where you put rice in the tube to make the sound if i bang on the wall really hard thats kind of what it sounds like back there i think its old crumbly plaster loosening and falling * my walls dont sound super hollow though there is some hollowness when tapped i can hear neighbors muffled conversation vs being able to make out word for word based on the description above can anyone confirm this sounds like plaster rather than any other material then knowing that my walls are plaster and not in the best shape is there still hope for me to hang things i live in a studio with super high ceilings so id like to be able to maximize storage specifically by adding more shelves and possibly mounting the tv screen so i think max weight would be about 50-75 lbs are toggle bolts perhaps the answer thanks in advance,0

how do i splice beams for a deck diagram included heya while away for work a contractor came in and poured some footings for a deck foundation instead of pouring them 8 apart or less they range from less than 8 to greater than 9 apart this means that instead of my 3-ply 2x8 beam having offset 16 boards spanning the 32 length of the deck i now have to splice beams in odd locations i dont know much about this at all if it helps the deck is only 1 to 2 off the ground max (sloped yard) [in this diagram i have 3 options ive come up * a - i splice every single beam segment over a post this seems the most stable against shear force but i have read in a few places online that this isnt ideal because youve got lateral weakness since the splice is through every board * b - i vary where my splices are the middle segment of beam splices over posts the sides splice over the span but are offset i dont like the idea of having a splice mid-span * c - inner section spans two posts splice is in the last quarter of the middle span outer sections splice over posts im leaning toward this but open to other suggestions in the diagram i try to show the layering of the beam such that the middle segment would be in the middle of the 3-ply beam when i look this up online i get multiple answers and i cant seem to find anything concrete i see diy videos on youtube of people splicing beams any which way and on other sites i see warnings never to splice anywhere except over a beam still other sites say not to splice all boards in a beam over a post then ill find some other site that says you *can* splice off a beam im confused - and ive never built something like this before this would be so much easier if the footings were in the right place but here i am any advice is greatly appreciated,0

"reclaimed barnwood table refinish: best approach for filling cracks holes and seams in tabletop [i picked up a reclaimed barn wood that i am in the process of refinishing ive sanded it down and i am preparing to do some repair prior to staining the top a dark color (either walnut or espresso) i love the character of the dings holes and seams in the wood however i have young children who will be eating off this table and who i know will relish shoving food down into any cracks so this table needs to be hygiene-proofed [there are a couple of damaged areas](https://iimgurcom/tlsrxfcjpg) where i will replace boards however there are still a lot of old nail holes seams between boards and general ""character"" just begging to be filled with applesauce and macncheese im considering a couple of approaches to filling all these so that it the table is easy to clean and i was hoping to get some guidance on which is the best: - the first approach is to simply use a stainable wood filler and then stain and put a polyurethane coating on top it looks like this table was originally made this way [as i can see some sort of old filler in some seams](https://iimgurcom/dqldmvtjpg) if this is the best route can you recommend a product its been a few years since i used a stainable wood filler but it didnt look *great* when i used it the filler absorbed the stain differently from the wood and looked very artificial i am particularly concerned about the appearance of the seams if i go this route - the second approach would be to seal the holes from the bottom of the tabletop maybe use some wood filler here and there and then to epoxy the table top my thoughts are that the clear epoxy would settle into the seams and holes allowing us to see that texture but be sealed off from the gross kids my concern here is that it will look to ""plastic"" thoughts alternative approaches thanks in advance",0

solitary 2x10 between kitchen studs i have what i hope is a simple question: i am in the process of making a pass-through between my kitchen and dining room and i just got the sheetrock down between two of the newly exposed studs is a solitary 2x10 the top edge of the board is a few inches below the plate and the bottom edge is (by extension) about a foot and a half from the ceiling it does not appear to be part of a header it is closest to the kitchen side of the wall and is held in by about half a dozen nails or so this is not a load-bearing wall any idea what this might be could it have been cabinet blocking at some point should i worry about removing this https://ireddit/tpgdhue9tgh31png,0

need help diagnosing the level of screwed up for some outlets in my basement hey reddit bought a home a few weeks ago and im working on some projects to get things up and running when we did the home inspection one of the outlets in the basement was reversed-polarity the home inspector noted that in his report however when we moved in that outlet is just simply dead on top of that another outlet closest to it is also dead (though on a different wall) when i put in a plug tester i dont get anything anymore im not sure if they tried and failed to fix it or what is going on there i decided to investigate the little that i know how to i shut off all the power and unscrewed the face plate and pulled the outlet out to double check the wires everything seemed fine to me no loose connections or anything i turned the power back on and tested the wires (still attached to the outlet if that matters) with a non-contact sensor but received no signal i busted out the multi-meter and tested them (after watching a youtube video to be sure i was touching the exact right thing to the exact right place) and received no reading at all i tested it by touching the multimeter terminals to the screws where the wires were connected the outlets that arent working are closest to the southwest corner of the house (which is an outer all) one on the south wall and one on the west wall the outlet i checked with the multi-meter is the one on the south wall however the next outlet on the south wall (a bit further east) is working the west wall outlet is the only one over there but everything on the north wall is working fine the breaker is north of this room as well if that matters given that the wires are dead what should i do is this a specific terminal issue or am i going to have to try and run new wiring what would my next troubleshooting steps be,0

"adding a gate to front porch w/vinyl siding would like to put a gate on the front porch where one side is wood and the other side is the house w/vinyl siding instead of putting it directly up against the house was considering using a 4x4 post using this type of base i cant seem to locate one with four sides and was considering getting two and setting them atop each other in opposite directions my reason for not installing against the siding and into the house is that its a rental and while i have permission to install the gate it must be removable when i move out and not leave any more work to be done the space right now is 53"" and with a 4x4 i figured i could get a 48"" prefab gate should this work https://ireddit/fp6fgrk6igh31jpg",0
"french drain help/opions here is a picture of my yard: i am installing a french drain because all alone a-b and b-c is constantly soggy/flooded from my neighbors and my rain run off i already tried to add to slope it a bit but there isnt much i can do i also have a fence along all of this my problem is from b-c my yard (and neighbors) are supposed to exit into a swale in the the back that runs to a county drain the problem is that it is barely 1% slop from b (the corner of my yard) to c (the start of the drain) if i put in a french drain then i would basically need to have it be a shallow as possible and then i am only going to get 5% slope to the bottom of the swale that is supposed to take water away from my house &#x200b; im not sure there is anything i can do here i actually have a 12"" deep x 14"" wide trench dug along c-b and a-b but when i checked the actual slope if i were to just put in a french drain along the bottom (fabric/stone/etc) it led me to believe it would just fill up with water and sit in my french drain &#x200b; does anyone have any thoughts should i still run the deep drain or try to slope it &#x200b; the only options i think i have is: &#x200b; 1) very shallow drain where i keep the slope as best i can 2) keep it deep stop short of the swale switch to drain pipe to hopefully flow it into the swale 3) keep it deep and add a dry well in my yard (i dont want to do this) 4) build a retaining wall essentially to prevent the water from flowing from swale into my yard have the french drain dump into it and pump the excess water up back into the swale &#x200b; &#x200b; \*\*\*no i cannot dig the swale deeper in the back it is part of a county drain and i am not supposed to be digging in it",0

strange plaster repair uk my partner and i bought our first house last year and are slowly redecorating and getting jobs done i was stripping wall paper in the living room and made note of a couple of patches that need repairing as i was going when i came across this: its an old repair that is failing i initially thought it was a repair to some chasing for the light switch for 2 spot lights but its basically thin sheet wood with steel mesh over it im in the uk and in my limited knowledge its not normal to repair chasing in this way ive not had a chance to fully uncover it as it will involve breaking through the wood and i didnt want to start creating a bigger job whilst it was starting to get dark any thoughts on what it could be just a creative repair for something,0

portable air conditioner shows negative room temperature and wont cool i have a portable air conditioner that i bought second hand it was supposedly only used four times and should work it worked ok for a bit but now i have this weird problem this is the unit: https://wwwmalmbergscom/products/9987024 the unit shows negative room temperature specifically it shows -9c if i move it just a bit it can change and become erratic before settling on another temperature most often it settles on -9 though earlier i got it to start by moving it slightly suddenly it would show the correct room temperature and start the compressor this has become harder and harder to do i cant seem to find the sweet spot anymore another thing worth mentioning is that moving it around can also provoke the code e2 in the display i dont know what it means and have contacted the manufacturer which also doesnt know i am suspecting a faulty ambient room temperature sensor the only problem with that theory is that actually moving the sensor that sticks out on the back over the coils does nothing i can clip it completely off and move it around but the temperature does not change only moving the unit itself helps i want to open it and see if something has happened with the plug or something but i have never done anything like that before i have asked the manufacturer if they have replacement sensors they do not the best thing would be to find what actual manufacturer probably in china makes these they must have some replacement sensors no any tips to get this unit to cool the room again would be highly appreciated,0

switch(es) blowing afci breaker [bathroom so i need some help (again) with an electrical issue i wired the basement and due to some new building code all the breakers are afci (which i am suspecting is a part of the problem) in the bathroom there 3 light switches labeled 12 & 3 on image switch 1 directs to a pot light and an led light switch 2 goes to a vanity light and 3 is a fan for months we havent been able to use switch 1 because it will trip the breaker not always immediately but usually within 30 seconds i spent all week trying to solve it i went into the device box and cleaned up the wires for the switches as best i could making sure nothing was exposed i replaced the switch (from another one in the basement so i knew it worked) this all improved the issue slightly in that it took a while longer to trip we kept thinking we had solved it and then short time later it would trip again here is where it gets weird we discovered an almost surefire way to make it trip was to have both light switches on (1 & 2) and then turn off switch 2 (ie the one that hasnt been a problem); switch 2 being turned off would kill the breaker as long as switch 1 was on i pulled out all the lights tested different combination of wiring such as one light being bypassed or cut off and this more or less holds true except now i find it takes the light a few minutes to heat up or whatever before turning off 2 while 1 is on will trip the breaker anyways there is not a lot of load on the circuit a tv and small deepfreeze and two lights that are rarely on (pantry) also i could just swap out the afci break for a regular since the inspector has come and gone,0

"horizontal drain on wall mount toilet im looking to install a wall mounted toilet in my basement but noticed all the steel fixtures are designed with a [vertical drop](https://iimgurcom/a2sccjwjpg) for the drain this makes sense in most cases but the location of where my vertical drain is not so much for me [here is a general set up of what i plan to do](https://iimgurcom/hbvd6bejpg) [and here is a general setup of how i plan to pipe it in](https://iimgurcom/iqz03qyjpg) i plan on installing the 4x4x4x2x2 sanitary tee with a 4"" internal pipe extender so that i dont need to break up the concrete this should make the center of the sanitary tee drain roughly 8""-85"" off the ground the rough-in for the wall mount toilet can be 5""-10"" from the finished floor depending on how high you personally want it i plan on having it about 9"" from the floor giving me 05""-10"" of elevation drop for about 15 to 20 of piping from the toilet to the drain giving me a worst case of 025"" per foot which is fine first question is: has anyone ever installed [one of these wall mounted frames](https://iimgurcom/a2sccjwjpg) with a horizontal drain connected to the main stack i cant see why this would be an issue but cant seem to find much information on this type of setup second question is: does my plumbing look alright im installing a cheater valve because each floor requires its own tie-in to a venting system even if im tied-in to the floor above venting instead of digging into my drywall a cheater should work fine i believe they are good for code in my area and i will be able to access it no problem if it ever fails and needs replacing thanks in advance",0

some outlets/lights on circuit not functioning after replacing outlets finally got around to replacing the 6 outlets in my final two bedrooms today and ran into some issues (prior to this had done all other outlets on this level with no issue over the last few months) so i replaced the outlets and went to turn the breaker back on was greeted by an immediate short and the breaker tripping went back up double checked that i hadnt left any loose wires on the new outlets and tried a few more times each time with the same result finally a friend mentioned that i might be getting a 240v short if i hadnt removed the bridging tab (this house has a mixture of [2 and [4 outlet wiring this sounded promising so i went and snapped all the tabs off on the 4 wire outlets and was able to turn the breaker back on this particular breaker has the garage the bedrooms (outlets and lights) and a couple outlets from the basement on it (its a tuck under style garage so the bedrooms are right over the garage) the garage door opener powered on and our internet was working (the cable connection uses one of the outlets in those back bedrooms) so i assumed everything was working and went to run a couple more errands however got back home and realized that those two things (the one outlet and the garage door opener) were the *only* functioning things on that circuit double checked all other breakers and everything looks good about ready to try and get an electrician out here but figured id post here first in case theres some simple fix like there was for my first dumb mistake thanks edit: been doing more research online read that it could be a tripped gcfi there is a single gcfi outlet in the garage but that appears to have no power to it checked all other gcfis in the house and they all appeared correct edit 2: went and checked all the _old_ outlets (had to dig them out of the trash which was gross) and they all seem to have actually had the tab soooo now im confused final edit: well i replaced all the outlets with more new ones this time keeping the tabs on flipped the breaker and everything works so i guess the world will never know but im glad to have power to everything again,0

feeling like an archaeologist - making sense of different wall layers when prepping for paint ive been stripping the woodchip wallpaper off a 1930 era uk property with the plan to paint the room pretty new to diy but trying to do as much research before each step and hoping to share a little progress here and get advice along the way on one wall the paper came off relatively easily with a steamer and revealed a solid grey wall which i presume is plaster it has a a crack going down it but planning on filling that then sanding is the length of this crack anything to worry about this wall gave me false hope for how easy the job would be as the next wall has been a real pain this wall is plasterboard and has many layers to it there are two solid white plaster pillars which i believe are the electrical chases the rest appears to be standard plasterboard with the dark brown paper type surface im doing my best to not chip into this along the way whilst removing the paper but it has happened a fair few times already in order to prepare this second wall for painting would i need to get it down to the dark brown layer fill cracks then sand the whole wall down to a smooth finish im also unsure whether the painting approach to both walls should be the same or if the wall with plasterboard may require lining paper too if it needs lining paper i may need to get the pros in thanks in advance for any pointers [images](https://mimgurcom/a/ywkjrxl),0

replacing janky overflow plate in bathtub looking for some insight on replacing an overflow plate in a bathtub whoever fixed this before basically caulked the hell out of it and called it a day [see the disaster here ](https://iimgurcom/hcgch9djpg)i removed all the old caulk and removed the overflow plate [i think there was a trip-lever before but could have rusted off](https://iimgurcom/smufgk4jpg)could also just be a single hole but am not sure seems like i can just remove the inner parts there and replace the entire thing with a new overflow plate am i correct do i need a specific type of overflow plate (one hole overflow plate like the one before or the kind with the trip-lever one with screws or without etc) just want to make sure i buy the correct replacement and do it right before i go ripping out anything else,0

help: fireplace brick repair in the process of removing some very old (and very stuck on) tile from the face of the chimney we ended up losing the faces of some brick none of the bricks are cracked theyre just missing 1-2mm from the surface of the brick is this purely cosmetic damage were trying to figure out the best path forward and so far it seems like our options are: 1 leave it paint over it deal with it being uneven in some places 2 attempt to repair the faces w/ some form of concrete/mortar 3 re-tile over it 4 have a mason come out and repair/replace the bricks we plan on painting the brick so if the solution involved somehow patching the brick faces matching the color wouldnt be something wed need to worry about some pictures of the damage,0
lvp glue removal over concrete for laminate installation im getting ready to remove some glue down lvp and install 12mm laminate with underlayment in its place im removing the lvp because the other half of the floor has carpet so i want to go back to all concrete and then put down the laminate the lvp has only been in place for about two years it pulls back up pretty easy and the glue below is still tacky and thin no ridges or puddles my question is do i need to try and remove all this glue prior to putting down the underlayment its sentinel brand underlayment basically like a foam im thinking the tackiness would just help hold the underlayment in place but im not sure if the glue would have any chemical reaction with the foam and break it down in any way or if theres any other reason i cant just put it straight over the glue any help would be appreciated thanks,0

need some help getting started with laying a hardwood floor i could use a little advice on what is the best way to start laying an engineered hardwood floor ive recently purchased a house and while they put new flooring on the first floor and stairs the upstairs was carpeted this is a tounge and groove flooring that i will be nailing down i have a couple of questions 1) what is the best way to start on the second floor i know the general advice is to find the longest exterior wall and start off it however in this case i have 1 strip of flooring around the perimeter of the stairs does it make more sense in this case to start my rows against what is already there if so any suggestions on where i have attached a pic of the stairs would i just butt up against it and face nail 2) ive laid floating floors and handled levelling the slab how does this work with a nail down floor i do have a couple of spots where the plywood sheets arent perfectly flat i could sand down the ridge do people use self leveling compound on the wood floors if so - how would you nail into that thanks for you suggestions &#x200b; &#x200b; https://ireddit/r9i0sxa7v3h31jpg [close up of perimeter shoddy cut job](https://ireddit/77knnob7v3h31jpg) &#x200b; &#x200b; https://ireddit/7vej1pmqv3h31jpg,0
gravel/sand to even out flooring for a floating floor so i came up with a what i think is a unique concept to put down sand or finer gravel instead of self leveling mix its liquid and uncontrollable for a large part it seems i figured you just set it all down and it will naturally fill in everything then you just refine till your level set down the padding as it should be accounted for in measuring then the floating lock-in flooring i just dont think it would be necessary for cement leveler,0

locating source of stray voltage im getting 30v on the common wire for an outlet at my house (30 nev single phase 120v) when i flip off the breaker of course it goes away so looks like probably stray voltage great now i want to find the source of the problem taking a measurement on the same circuit closer to the breaker panel theres no nev so i guess there are three possibilities: 1 examine wiring and receptacles downstream (farther away from the panel past the outlet showing nev) 2 examine wiring and receptacles upstream (between the measurement with no nev and the one with nev) 3 the entire circuit should show nev this isnt a stray voltage issue thoughts as a side note troubleshooting the entire circuit is laborious so id like go the right direction from the problem outlet thanks edit: additionally i did a fair amount of googling and found a lot of related information that didnt answer my question,0

ceiling fan wiring question electricity baffles me i can frame you a house but know nearly nothing about electrical my house was built in late 2018 the builder saved money by building the 2nd and 3rd bedrooms with a single switch and light i am putting new hunter fans with lights in each room i want the switch to provide power and i will control the light and/or fan by the switch chains hanging down from the fan the ceiling has 5 wires: bare copper green black white and red (it looks like the green just grounds to the box in the ceiling) the fan mount has a single green/yellow wire attached to the side of the mount itself the fan itself has 4 wires: green/yellow white blue and black the instructions say for a single switch: - connect ceiling bare copper to the 2 fan green/yellows - connect the ceiling black wire to the fan black and blue wires - connect ceiling white to fan white - no mention of red this does not work when i hook it up this way when i took the original light down the only 2 ceiling wires hooked up were red and white i am guessing the red has power by my tester has been missing since we moved a few months ago (i try to never use guess and electricity in the same sentence but) any help would be appreciated edit: solved,0

open loft hatch from floor without a pole hi all hoping someone might be able to help; ive just had my loft hatch break away from the loft ladder and instead of simply fixing it ive thought it would be a good excuse to actually replace the whole thing as ive been annoyed at having to use the pole to open the thing but having searched online i cant seem to find a hatch door with handle that would allow me to open the loft from the floor below (id been dreaming in my head of a handle that runs flush with the loft door with a cord that i could reach to pull at the handle which would pull down or twist to allow me to open the loft when closing i could use the handle to push the loft door closed and when i let go it springs back up flush with the loft door again) as i say ive searched google but it seems all loft hatches require a pole to open i must say i was surprised that it wasnt more of a popular (or even possible) thing thinking of the physics of it more i can sort of understand lol but hoping that someone here has seen something on their travels &#x200b; tl;dr: has anyone here come across anything that might allow me to open and close the loft hatch without a pole from the floor below,0
releasing a 2 part plaster mold im sure the answer to this is out there somewhere but i cant seem to find it im making a 2 piece mold to cast wolf wax (machine wax) positives for casting in 1 piece investment powder molds via a burnout i have a bag of plaster of paris that im attempting to use to make a master with to save myself 50$ investment powder isnt cheap this isnt by first time making molds of various materials and im familiar with all but one problem here what im about to describe is by no means the proper way to do this with plaster so input there is also appreciated if there is an easier or more correct way ive done some small scale tests with a section of cured plaster i applied an oil that i felt was of the right consistency not to absorb too deeply (vegetable oil) to the mating surface i then poured freshly mixed plaster onto it ive done this before without oil and noticed that plaster tends to naturally seperate along a line where 2 different batches were poured after the first was cured in this test they did seperate as such but a couple pieces seemed to push the oil out of the way (along the edges and directly in the center where it was poured) and these areas bit hard enough to worry me on a large scale (2 sq/ft) mold even if small areas bite on that size of mold this can quickly become a problem is there something that works better to allow them to release while not soaking into the poures is this completely wrong and i should be using another method entirely to be clear im not casting with a metal positive and my problem isnt getting the master pattern to release from the plaster its in getting the plaster halves to release from themselves after pouring the second half i have used some other materials such as corn starch and even mold release which i typically use in my silicone 2 part molds to the same effect maybe its my coverage and im missing spots or maybe the lils are beading up during the few minutes where im mixing i dont know what the heck is everyone doing to get 2 halves of plaster to seperate,0

is sealing and insulating basement sills a good idea i have an unfinished basement with open joists and sills there are definitely drafts of air coming in around the edge where the joists rest on the top of the foundation i am thinking of sealing in between the joists by filling the space between joists with fibreglass insulation batting then foam board sealed with expanding foam that will prevent any air flow into the basement and insulate from the outside wall above the sills however there are two concerns i have: 1) do i also need to seal around the outside edge with caulking or expanding foam where the outside wall meets the foundation otherwise im wondering if i will be forcing outside air up inside the wall or at least in the space between the outside wall and foam board 2) the drafty basement was being ventilated by that small amount of airflow will it create knock-on affects because of reduced or no air exchange now like mustiness or dampness do modern airtight basements require ventilation if anyone can offer any advice id really appreciate it,0

restoring an old rusty craftsman toolbox so i got a used craftsman tool box for $0 its in really good condition except for the bottom drawer which must have held water its extremely rusty theres some small surface rust here and there elsewhere ive been doing tons of research and i cant find a method im 100% confident in to remove rust before painting without ending up with either a thick rust converter layer or the rust returning under the new paint there seems to be many opinions on the internet and different methods for different applications ive already broken down the tool box into its components this is the plan im currently considering: 1 use a wirebrush to remove any rust flakes 2 sand remaining surface rust 3 spray surface rust areas with rust converter (is this even necessary) 4 powerwash any remaining dirt/grime/grease off the entire box then dry completely 5 spray paint entire tool box with rustoleum universal all surface does this seem right i dont have access to a sandblaster otherwise id strip everything down to the metal and paint,0

bulletin board walls there are murals on my basement walls id like to cover them up with floor-to-ceiling bulletin boards for my home office but i cant damage the murals so far ive only see [this](https://wwwyounghouselovecom/more-room-for-grumpy-snowman/) kind of project where a thin wood panel backing is attached to the wall with drilled screws and i cant drill holes it seems like i can buy large sheets of corkboard ([here](https://wwwschooloutfitterscom/catalog/product_info/pfam_id/pfam25035/products_id/pro39992sc_cid=google_nor-rc46&adtype=pla&kw=&cawelaid=1238934288&cagpspn=pla&caagid=12912490097&catci=pla-789063711765&gclid=eaiaiqobchmi5bvx9lcf5aivrp_jbx04iqjheaqybsabegimz_d_bwe)) or ones that come with backing already attached ([novacork from homasote](http://wwwhomasotecom/products/novacork)) but the installation instructions appear to require drilling a few holes in the wall [this video](https://wwwyoutubecom/watchtime_continue=2&v=r4nrzwjtpz4) shows how to use glue but i think that will damage the mural too and wouldnt it also risk pushpins poking holes through the cork into the wall at about 2:25 that video suggests that painters tape can be used instead (which seems to me to be the best option so far) but wouldnt i still have to put some kind of backing there (and if i am using tape whereas homasote suggests drilling am i risking the whole thing falling down on me) im happy to hire someone to do this but i need to know what they would be doing if its even possible help,0

[discussion] poor paintjob fix so i have a launchpad that i disassembled because i wanted to paint it white in order for the paint to stick to it i gave it a good sanding and then i spray painted it apparently i went too hard on the sanding and i applied a thick layer of paint to compensate while visually it looks fine it feels rough and dusty on the hand is it worth it to sand down the paint and get a fine grid sandpaper to make it smooth and then repaint it or should i just leave it as is it was my first diy paint project and i am dissapointed that i kinda messed it up my following projects turned out pretty damn well might i say but this one this one makes me sad :)),0

how to fix an inherited chest freezer so my dad had a 25 year old chest freezer that defrosted and stopped cooling so he gave it to me i was hoping it would be something easy to fix like a bad relay or a wire got corroded and disconnected so the freezer turns on after plugging it in without problem the condenser makes a low hum like it is working the condenser does heat up as well after being on a while after leaving it overnight the condenser never turns off not even for a short time the tubes coming out of the condenser are warm on both sides the inside of the freezer does not change temperature at all from what ive read i believe with a bad relay the condenser generally switches on and off a bad temperature control thermostat (potentiometer) also relates to turning on the condenser what ive come up with is that i may have a freon leak is there a way to test this or another more likely problem or did i miss something and is there something else i should check,0

first time buyer house has an old window resized with plasterboard how can i fix it **background:** me and my fiance bought a house last year and we have since renovated two bedrooms the lounge and the garden it was well looked after by the previous owner but very dated as she had owned it since the 70s and had used wood chip wallpaper to hide numerous sins fortunately ive been able to fix it to a standard we are happy with but i am now starting on the kitchen **problem:** unfortunately the [dining area window](https://iimgurcom/ylskhiwjpg) was made smaller when an extension was built onto the back of the house and the plasterboard () used to resize it is [significantly thicker than the rest of the wall](https://iimgurcom/uy7kkg6jpg) is there anyway to fix this without removing the material and starting over im not sure what the best way to tackle it would be **unsuccessful attempt:** out of sheer optimism [i used an electric plane on a small area](https://iimgurcom/qt1ihqbjpg) but it wont cut deep enough and it created a significant amount of dust and im not entirely convinced shaving the plaster down is the right solution **context:** the house is in the uk was built in the 50s all the walls are built from brick (even the internal walls) this is the only patch of plasterboard/mystery material that needs fixing any help or advice would be greatly appreciated,0

transforming carpet stairs to wood for under $100 re-posted since original post was deleted for not having enough info redditors please let me know if the information below is enough for someone to perform the same project if not let me know what information do you want to know i felt like admin wrongfully deleted my original post our stairs were carpet and it was so ugly we had to do something about it we decided to make it a diy project after seeing so many people having success transforming their carpet stairs to wood saturday we had to pull up the carpet tools required utility knife and gloves after we pulled out the carpets there were thousands of stables stuck to the wood and carpet glues or whatever those white stuff are sunday-thursday next step is using a plier and hand pull the staples it was so many i almost gave up but i decided to pull some everyday after work then we used a $5 plastic wood filler from hd to fill up all the major holes that were on the wood friday-saturday next we borrow a sanding machine from a friend and bought a large pack of sanding on amazon for $12 we taped a plastic sheet at the top of the stair and at the bottom of the stairs while we sand to minimize the particles from going everywhere in the house probably only stopped like 60% sanding took a lot longer than we exepcted 2 full days of work to sand the steps and the railing so it can be stained also sunday-monday after we finished sanding we used an $8 wood stain i believe the color is kona first time staining wood i did not wipe it quickly enough so the color appeared much darker almost black on pictures we stained every other step so we can still get upstairs to our bedroom tuesday-thursday we applied a $20 floor finisher (semi-gloss) on the wood same step as staining we applied every other steps friday for the backboard we bought 2 of the 48x96 in beadboard white true bead panel from hd for $40 we cut it up to size with a table saw and used liquid nails to attach it to the backboard the whole project spanned over 3 weeks and probably spent about 45-50 hours to finish the color was darker than expected but it looks nice with the white backboard,0

is it possible to fix this door if so how do i do it it seems to be thinly layered wood some of the layers are bent inwards and are hard to pop back ideally the door would be restored to almost original state but if i can just even the surface its sufficient as well i have a large poster to cover almost the entire door [image of the door](https://ibbco/vmhk6yv) update: i sprayed some expanding foam into the door via the small cracks waited 2 hours for it to expand (and boy did it) after that i used thin white woodfiller and applied it generously that was a bit of a mistake because it started cracking after drying so i sanded it back down with g80 and then applied a new thin layer that has now dried and ive sanded it again this time with g180 its now very smooth and flush with the rest of the door except for the edges with tend to crumble when sanding to thin [heres another picture](https://ibbco/qnzr8jt) next step will be either painting or putting a wallpaper with a nice graphic on the door im thinking the latter because itll hide the edges better,0

"hoping for some information on what i can and cannot expect from bondo tl;dr - if i were to try to make something like the green calf-plates on [these awesome spur-pads](https://wwwsherrilltreecom/media/catalog/product/cache/1/small_image/241x/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/4/1/41150-gecko-steel-climbers-webjpg) would a fiberglass product like bondo be a worthwhile approach or would it just shatter / crack-up the first time it was used id be using reinforcements inside the layers of fiberglass but unsure if its an ok material to use at all here am guessing the product shown uses a plastic ~~~~~~~~ i love diy and make my own stuff whenever i can sadly this (fiberglass resins) is an area im woefully unfamiliar with im skilled with fast-setting stuff like bondo like i can use 5min drywall spackle w/o issue fast-dry cement-based products have just never used this stuff so while i expect it *could* work i think my biggest uncertainty is just how fragile the stuff is going to be when making something thats subjected to minor pressures and is relatively-speaking a very skinny casting/form (those pad-shells i want to make so my diy spurs padding isnt just lashed in-place with nylon webbing lol are going to be like 1/2"" thick but an ~8""x12"" footprint) of course ill be using some form of skeleton inside it i didnt realize i omitted fiberglass sheeting til i got home but have to expect that the flexible-yet-resilient fabric i have thats used in the same manner only for roofing-tars that thatll be suitable here - im also picturing rebar (read: bicycle spokes that ill just cut-to-size with the angle-grinder) used both throughout the body as well as ""a border""/around the entire perimeter of such a project - is this type of approach going to be something thats more or less likely to work thanks a ton for any&all help/advice i love the idea of being able to use forms to make things with something besides cement/mortars because of their inherent limitations ive got a good feeling this is the right path for say making a custom outer-shell for a chainsaw or things like that but ive never worked with it or seen it worked with so hoping for thoughts on whether my expectations for it are wayyy too high or not lol :d again thank you for any answers/suggestions/tips etc they are greatly appreciated [ps- i just wanna be super clear about the spur-padding project this is not going to risk my spurs grip if the thing failed as its only function would be to contour my rubber padding to my leg id still have my same 1"" nylon webbing going around the spurs upper-metal rod so this is really just aesthetics but since my calf will be bumping it id hate to waste teh time just to find theyre full of cracks after the first use - *if* thats the case/expectation any suggestions on what else to do / use would be greatly appreciated for instance i know that some of these pad shells are made of carbon fiber and so far as i understand it thats basically the same as bondo+fiberglass sheeting (only its stronger because the carbon-fiber sheeting is stronger - though im clueless whether its 50% or 5000% stronger]",0

"best way to enlarge a hole from 125""-15"" or larger im a gardener and as part of that hobby i have rain barrels i got these particular rain barrels from our local environmental action council & some from craigslist which look like the original owners obtained from the same council the problem i am having is that the plumbing fixtures that were added were siliconed on and not super well so i have been replacing them with bulkhead fittings with hose threading--the spigots/taps worked out great but the overflows are still not large enough this means that i cant daisy chain the barrels together currently initially i expanded the holes from 3/4"" to 1-1/4"" using a step drill for the the current overflows id like to expand the overflows to 1-1/2"" or potentially larger but i cant seem to find the right way or tool to do this i cant seem to find a step drill over 1-3/8"" where my current one maxes out and i cant use the oops arbors i have seen because the arbor on those is circular whereas my holesaw kit has a sort of square off circular arbor im considering using my step drill to max the holes out to 1-3/8"" and then using either my dremel tool or a file/rasp to expand it that last 1/8"" how viable a solution is this should i try something else edit: thank you all for your kind suggestions i decided to go with the step drill & file combo i planned on with u/misterhiggins confirming it was a viable option it took longer than i thought but not very long the hole isnt quite perfect but since this was for the gasket that the hose goes into its perfect enough id recommend anyone interested in purchasing a holesaw kit to first consider buying a spade bit/paddle bit instead also get a kit with circular arbors so you can use oops arbors or you know just drill the right size hole or dont try to retrofit something with the wrong size hole",0
help request: replacing a power receptacle in an old house with old wires i need to replace a two-hole power outlet with a new two-hole power outlet and i ran into a little issue i think the wiring in my house is fairly old since it was built in 1950 so i need some help understanding how things work the instructions ive seen on youtube and just about any other diy guide only talk about black and white wires but this one only has black and brown wires (please take a look at [this picture](https://ibbco/qgq4rcr) of my wiring) **so my question is:** **which wire goes on the left** **(black or brown) where the bigger prong on a plug is inserted** *im totally new to electrical* *and* *trying to maintain a low-frizz buzz cut* *thank you for your help* bonus karma: i know two-hole receptacles should be upgraded to three-hole receptacles with gfci and grounding if i wanted to replace my old two-hole receptacles with gfci could i do this with only those two pictured wires (black and brown),0

why is this screw not fitting in this tapped hole hello r/diy this is my first project using metal aluminium specifically ive managed to drill and tap a m4 07 thread into the end of a rod but the m4 07 screws i bought seem to be damaging the internal threads and not screwing in smoothly at all have i created the internal thread incorrectly or are my screws just badly sized any help massively appreciated solved: i wasnt aware that the tap i was using was a tapered tap and therefore only the first (or last) few threads are deep enough to accommodate the bolt looks like ill have to get a bottoming tap,0

i built an outdoor wood fired brick oven (aic) first post was removed i hope i got this one right sorry let me start by saying i am by no means a professional brick mason or artisan i started building this oven in mid april with an 18 month old child full time job and plenty of other chores around the house it was tough to carve out the time needed to complete it i attempted to complete and have pizzas by july 4th but it just wasnt in the cards with all of our other family activities but last weekend we finally broke it in with a delightful pizza party my goal is to build a roof structure over it before the weather hits this fall all in id say i have about 100-150 hours into it it weighs somewhere between 12000 -15000 pounds i truly enjoy the labor it was sometimes a good way to clear my head at the end of a difficult work day this is the 2nd oven ive completed the first one was built at our previous home and unfortunately we unexpectedly moved about 8 months after it was completed,0

retiling kitchen - do i have to go right down to the plywood or can i smooth and reuse the thinset ive begun renovating my kitchen and have removed everything just drywall wires and dust remain we are on the 4th floor of a condo wood frame built in 91 ive pulled up all the tiles and im in the process of scraping away all the old mortar underneath is a layer of what looks like gray concrete and under that i assume is the plywood 1 what most likely is this layer it is smooth and grey and looks/feels like concrete it is quite pitted where the tiles were but smooth where the cabinets were could it be backerboard i dont see any screws or obvious seams 2 whatever this layer is can i just patch and smooth over the pits and lay new tile over it the old tiles i pulled up were installed in 91 when the building was built and none were cracked so i assume the floor was fairly well done and level thanks,0

help request: hvac intake removal i currently am taking out a closet that contained an old gas furnace it looks like the gas furnace plugged directly into the hvac ducts the gas furnace has since been removed and the intake (i think) part that connected the furnace now hangs about 3 or 4 inches below the ceiling currently the part has little vent windows that can be moved by hand (and is not plugged in any way) would i be able to go up in the attic cut this t-shaped intake out and replace with new duct how should i go about doing this i want to hang drywall where this vent currently is and make the ceiling cohesive,0
help - fitting shelves to plasterboard wall fairly handy in general but ive never mounted shelves on a plasterboard wall the shelves ive picked out are floating shelves reclaimed pine from scaffolding boards what im not sure about (and cant get a nice clear answer from google) is what additional steps or support for the shelves is required - a lot of the vendors i have seen say not suitable for plasterboard etc im assuming the reason is heavier shelves or heavily loaded shelves are more likely to fail any advice would be appreciated,0

help request: how do you put a bolt into a hole without an exit to put a nut on long story short i bought an arena seat when they tore down the hockey rink in detroit and am finally getting around to fixing them up theres three arm rests/mounting brackets for the two seats the first two are identical and have screw holes that go through the hollow bracket and then you can just put the nut on the outside but the third bracket doesnt have an exit hole through the bracket so its just a hole (no threads) to put a bolt into with noway to put a nut on is there some type of bolt or screw designed for this kind of thing,0
help request: swingset revival i never considered myself to be handy but my confidence has been growing since i became a home owner a few years ago however my latest project seems to go wrong at every turn despite it seeming very easy we have had a playset for the last two years however it is already starting to show some wear and i wanted to get out in front of things so that it stayed looking like new first i powerwashed because i had some mold/mildew stains i tried to be careful and not get too close or stay on one section for too long however despite my best efforts i fear that i did some damage to the wood then i tried using a deck/wood cleaner saw more success but still had some blotchy areas i tested out a semi-transparent stain/sealant but after one coat i already think i need something that does not show the wood grain (for reference in the imgur link the bench has one coat of stain) normally i would keep plugging away but i fear continuing this path and doing irreparable damage to a relatively new swingset does anybody have any advice when it comes to these projects do i have to sand (and to what effect) before staining if the wood seems to be in good shape any specific types to use imgur gallery:,0

over the range microwave installation issue i installed an over the range microwave yesterday but overtightened the top screws as such the mounting bracket is not bearing any load i think simply loosening the top bolts is not the correct solution i also cant move the bracket up because the new screw holes would be merged with the current ones what can i do to put weight on the bracket now instead of the top bolts thanks,0
"is polyurethane the correct resin for my application so i bought an electric scooter and i wanted to make it go faster so i 3d printed a bigger gear which ended up spinning when the motor shaft got hot due to the extra load so i set out to mold it in silicone and cast an epoxy gear drilled a hole through the shaft and drove a pin through the gear and the shaft took it to the convenience store to grab some beer and smokes and ended up walking back because the gear ended up tearing at the pin and then spun so ive been doing some research and it looks like i want to be using polyurethane resin but i want to be 100% sure before i shell out $45 this particular kit im looking at has a heat deflection temperature of 300f and a shore hardness of 70d i think this is the stuff im looking for but can someone please confirm it is called ""model-pro"" by src",0
