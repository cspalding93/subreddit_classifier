replac the floor tile on my 1960 shower that sit abov my garag in our split level hous my goal wa not onli to replac the tile itself becaus it wa veri old and pretti nasti but to examin the shower base beneath which i knew wa compromis becaus it had start slowli drip into my garag below ive pull up the tile and it wa veri obviou where water wa get through (to the right of the drain in imag #1 below) becaus the materi in thi area wa soft and somewhat muddi / sandi wherea everywher els it wa firm and hard in the pictur below i have dug out that area to get to the subfloor beneath (which is not veri rot but definit damp) i wa also abl to determin (im pretti sure) how water wa get into my garag below if you look at the third pictur below you can see my finger point to a gap around thi flang or whatev on the drain pipe i think thi area wa satur with water and that wa the releas point for ani excess water that came through thi is consist with what we were see below with water drip down thi pipe on the outsid of it you can see a littl bit of daylight in pictur #4 and thi is where my finger is in pictur #3 where ive dug out all the way to thi part of the drain here are some to show what im talk about so thi lead me to a few questions: 1 how wa water get through in the first place my guess is that it wa slowli seep through my tile in thi section of the shower we had veri small tile which mean a ton of grout line it make sens to me that over time those seal in between tile were not keep water out and water wa slowli get below below and here we are the water satur that section and then the water found a releas under that part of the drain shown in the pictur agre or think someth els wa happen here i understand it could also have been leak around the mouth of the drain where the drain meet the tile either way that would be a tile not be seal well issu right 2 do i need to consid replac my drain or is it like fine one thing ive done befor rip up all the tile wa to pour copiou amount of water straight down the drain and ive had no issu with water leakag below i realli do believ water that get into the drain is fine i think it just that i had water get through the tile / base and come down the side of thi drain but if i were to have new tile with new grout and a new moistur barrier / membran on top of thi is my drain like good to keep as-i or is it one of those thing where sinc ive gotten thi far i should look into get the drain out i dont realli want to do it ""just becaus ive come thi far"" but i also dont want to not do it if it realli need to happen if you think thi thing is just so old and it like compromis in way that im not realiz and it need to go let me know 3 thi lead to my anoth big question where do i go from here as far as get readi to put tile back on i have done some research about use either a liquid membran like redguard or one of the waterproof membran ""rolls"" but is that someth i could appli on top of thi exist base (shown in imag #1) or do i need to consid remov all of thi old base and get down to my subfloor my thought ha been that most of thi materi is in tact and solid except where it wa damag on the right side so perhap i should build on top of thi layer in other word get my subfloor dri out and patch up then fill in the chunk that ive taken out (with what some type of mortar mix) and then use thi as my base layer that i start rebuild tile and if so what do you recommend do next do i appli a waterproof layer on top of thi and then some sort of prefab shower tray (like schluter kerdi) on top of a thinset mortar then put more thinset mortar and tile the biggest issu with thi layer current is that it not perfectli smooth sinc the tile pull up some of thi layer with it and it a bit splotchi doe it make more sens to not use a prefab tray and to just refinish thi layer with some type of overlay (keep in mind the pitch etc) and then waterproof it and tile it or is that prefab tray a good way to go just becaus it ha the right pitch it made of a good materi etc i know that a lot of question but hope my gener question make sense: how do i get from where i am now in these pictur to a place that is readi to tile 4 obvious if i do use thi base layer as my foundat on which im go to re-til and if i do build on thi layer just a littl bit with waterproof membran mortar etc then my new tile is go to be rais slightli higher than my old tile which will make it hard to seal around my drain do i consid someth like one of these ""extend o-drain"" [kits](https://wwwamazoncom/extendo-o-drain-extend-o-drain-4-3-8/dp/b007bv6ed8/ref=asc_df_b007bv6ed8/tag=hyprod-20&linkcode=df0&hvadid=198111101494&hvpos=1o1&hvnetw=g&hvrand=14607906552616376246&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9012564&hvtargid=pla-351737196878&psc=1)

579,easi privaci shutter for bathroom window made from paint ruler and pvc pipe ive had thi up for almost 2 year alreadi want to share my [diy privaci shutter which is my solut to a window that is place at chest level right in our shower area the shutter allow us to keep the window open but also provid us privaci we keep the shower window open at all time to promot airflow and prevent moistur and mold sinc the previou owner did not instal an exhaust fan (probabl becaus they chose a window instead) the other bathroom doesnt have a window but doe have a fan a curtain would be the immedi solut for privaci but it would constantli be wet the perimet is made out of pvc pipe and elbow connect to fit the insid of the window make sure to take in your measur to account for when the elbow slide into the pipe that shorten your measur i didnt account for that and onli measur the full length of each of the piec and forgot that it still ha to slide into the elbow and i will lose some inch but in the end i got lucki and it still fit it wa good anyway becaus sinc it wa smaller i wa abl to wiggl it in diagon when assembl and i also made it shorter than the actual open so that it can stand upright as i slide the window close on top of it to hold it in place i drill hole along the side of the pipe and these are where the pin go i took home depot ruler and cut them to size by assembl the frame first and then measur from one end of the inner perimet to the other end and use that measur to cut the ruler thi also make sure there are no big gap at the top of the ruler when instal then i coat them with white water resist paint- similar to what they use on bathroom walls- i think spray paint would have been easier i did 2 coat by hand and that wa the longest part one thing i would suggest is that the ruler that are on either end closest to the vertic pvc frame should be wider or fatter becaus the elbow prevent it from swing fulli close so there is a larger gap mayb super glue two ruler togeth at the edg to make a wider one for those end i hammer some stainless steel nail to both of the edg of the ruler leav a big portion of it stick out so it can be insert into the hole you made in the pvc pipe sinc the ruler is so slim you want the thinnest nail so you dont split the ruler when you nail it in the ruler swing around if you want to open them or close them by hand exactli like shutter just make sure when you are measur where to put the hole in the pipe that the ruler lay slightli on top of the other as to prevent huge gap where peopl can peek through when you put it in the close posit to assembl the ruler i first put all the pin on the top side then i line up the pin on the bottom and i close the pipe togeth thi wa tricki sinc there are a lot of hole and pin and line up i recommend a second person to help important: peopl recommend that i instal an actual exhaust fan sinc air moistur out with a window is ineffici so pleas dont do thi if ur onli tri to exhaust a bathroom if you like to shower with the window open but want some privaci and have extra airflow then thi can be good for you note that i also live in southern california where keep the window open is not a huge issu all year round,0,0

$35 \- nema23 15:1 stepper motor - $75 \- tb6600 stepper motor driver - $10 \- digit calip - $8 \- circuit for calip (dc-dc convert level shifter) - $3 $2 \- gx16 connector (34 and 5 poles) - $10 \- 5 kn load cell - $62 \- ek08 support bear (for the shaft for the worm gears) - 2 x $13 \- crosshead piec (laser cut custom design) - 6 x $7 \- 1m-20t worm gear set (gear and wheel) - 2 x $12 \- twin lead screw with nut - 2 x $ 42 \- custom made grip (cnc custom design) - 2 x $53 \- pillow bear - 2 x $265 \- bk10 support bear (main bear for the lead screws) - 2 x $12 \- arduino and other circuit (uno nano hx711) - $3 $2 $12 \- power suppli - $15 \- plastic box - $8 \------------------------------------- sum \~ $550 but thi is a veri rough estim sinc the price of the custom made part can vari i also havent consid the cost of the tool and small part that i alreadi had at home or i actual had to buy small screw spare part wire solder stuff etc furthermor the hour i spent on design program assembl and disassembl thi sever time etc the realiti is more close to $1000 if you want to buy everyth from a proper seller and in high qualiti i bought most of the stuff from china from random seller from alibaba (in fact i am veri satisfi with them and those products) and from other mostli chines websit the system is capabl of measur much larger forc (about 20 kn) easili but base on the current load cell i am limit to 500 kg it is realli difficult to find cheap and small load cell with higher capac i am still work on thi machin and hope i will be abl to turn it into a nice product at the end the program part is about 90% done (some improv can be done and i want some more fanci features) so most of the work should be done on the mechan part i will do more test with differ materi in the futur and i will also publish them as video,0,0
